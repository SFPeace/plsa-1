[[Expedition 26 crew blast off to space station]]The Expedition 26 crew, comprising of Russian, American and Italian astronauts, launched to the International Space Station from the {w|Baikonur Cosmodrome} in Kazakhstan on Thursday at 1:09 am local time. The crew, which comprised of Russian Dmitry Kondratyev, American Catherine Coleman and Italian Paolo Nespoli, launched aboard the {w|Soyuz TMA-20} and will dock with the station Friday afternoon. With a flash of light, the rocket lifted off the pad and soared towards the heavens resembling a star of white light according to launch footage. Updates were given over the loudspeaker every 20 seconds until the nine minute mark which signaled that the capsule had reached stable orbit. This was greeted by hearty cheers. The station currently houses Commander Scott Kelly and Flight Engineers Alexander Kaleri and Oleg Skripochka who have been aboard the station since October 9. They are slated to leave the station in March of next year. Once they depart, the recently launched Expedition 26 crew members will become Expedition 27. The launch was scheduled to take place several days ago, however it had to be postponed to facilitate the replacement of the reentry capsule which was damaged while it was being unloaded at the Cosmodrome earlier this year. Replacing such a key component so close to the laucnch date caused some fear, however astronaut Dmitry Kondratyev dismissed these fears at the pre-launch press conference, "All the procedures needed to check the integrity of the ship have been completed, and all those have shown positive results."The astronauts stayed at the Cosmonaut Hotel in Baikonur for two weeks before the launch. This launch marks ten years of flights to the ISS which began in October 2000. == Sources ==

[[Wikileaks founder Julian Assange granted bail, set free]]The founder of the whistle blowing website Wikileaks, Julian Assange, has been granted bail and was set free, pending an extradition hearing. Justice Duncan Ouseley granted Assange "conditional bail," upholding the previous ruling which was made earlier in the week. He ruled against a Swedish appeal filed just two days ago. Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden for alleged molestation and rape.On Tuesday, Assange was granted bail with the help of former British army officer and journalist {w|Vaughan Smith}, who told the court that Assange could stay at his mansion in Suffolk. Defense barrister Geoffrey Robertson said that Smith would keep Assange "if not under house arrest, at least under mansion arrest." Assange's lawyers say that Assange is only wanted for questioning, and has not been charged with any crimes. However the lawyers representing Sweden countered by saying "The court has already found that Mr. Assange is a flight risk. Nothing has changed in this regard. [If the alleged offences took place in Britain] it undoubtedly would have been a charge of rape in this jurisdiction." Robertson did not agree.Bail was set at ?200,000, with two additional guarantees of ?20,000. Assange would also have to surrender his passport and submit to electronic monitoring. Pending further court hearings, Assange will be residing in a manor owned by Smith, which is located near the Norfolk¨C{w|Suffolk} border in England. Assange would also have to spend at least four hours at Smith's mansion in the day and four at night. He will also have to check in with police every day between 6¨C8 pm local time. After the magistrate outlined the conditions Assange said, emotionlessly, on Tuesday, "I understand." Bail conditions remained the same, with small changes that included where he is allowed to travel, changes to his curfew and times in which he must report to authorities. Assange has yet to be formally charged with any crime.Assange believes the sex offense accusation against him are politically motivated to take attention away from material that Wikileaks is publishing, including the release of over 250,000 United States diplomatic cables.

[[North Korea warns of 'self-defensive blows,' nuclear war, if military exercises take place]]North Korea has warned of "self-defensive blows" to South Korea if they participate in joint, live-fire military exercises with the United States, scheduled to begin in the next few days. The U.S. and South Korea will be taking part in a one day, live-fire exercise on Yeonpyeong Island, the island which was shelled by North Korean artillery on November 23. Nearly 200 rounds of artillery were fired at the island. Four people were killed and another 14 were injured in the attack. South Korea had been taking part in annual military exercises with the U.S., off the island's west coast when the attack occurred. They returned fire, firing nearly 80 rounds of artillery, but no damage was reported on the North Korean side."Second and third self-defensive blows that cannot be predicted will be dealt. The intensity and range of the firepower will create a situation more serious than one on Nov. 23," said a statement released by the North Korean government via the {w|Korean Central News Agency}, the country's main news agency. It accused the two nations of creating "hysteria of war of aggression against the DPRK, escalating the military tension and confrontation." The nation's official website Uriminzokkiri, warns that "if war breaks out, it will lead to nuclear warfare and not be limited to the Korean Peninsula."North Korea further demands the exercises be canceled saying, "the South Korean puppet warmongers must immediately cancel the provocative coastal live-fire drills planned on Yeonpyeong." The country considers any exercises that take place on Yeonpyeong Island, to be a violation of their territory.According to the {w|United States Department of State|U.S. State Department}, the exercises are part of regular drills between the U.S. and South Korea and are not provocative. "These are routine exercises. There¡¯s nothing provocative or unusual or threatening about these exercises. The North Koreans have been notified about what South Korea plans to do," said Philip J. Crowley, a spokesman for the State Department. The U.S. and South Korea have no plans to cancel the exercises.
[[Australian Federal Police say Wikileaks committed no crime]]The Australian Federal Police has stated that the whistle-blowing website known as WikiLeaks has committed no crimes in Australia by publishing over 250,000 United States diplomatic cables. An investigation by the AFP into the release of the cables revealed that Wikileaks had not broken any laws under Australian jurisdiction."[The AFP has] not identified any criminal offences where Australia has jurisdiction and as a result have not commenced an investigation," said Robert McClelland, attorney-general of Australia in a statement to the press. "As has previously been stated, given the documents published to date are classified by the United States, the primary jurisdiction for any investigation into the matter remains the United States."The investigation into Wikileaks actions came after the Australian Government referred the release of U.S. diplomatic cables to the AFP. McClelland stated that the Government's reaction to the WikiLeaks issue was "prudent." Further cables that the Government queries the legality of would also be forwarded to the AFP as well. He also added that the government remains "concerned" about the situation and "unauthorised and irresponsible distribution of classified material."Controversy had also been raised today after Julia Gillard changed her stance on the release of the cables from calling the action "illegal," to calling it "grossly irresponsible," after the AFP had released their findings. Ms Gillard said at a press-conference in Sydney today that she did not intend to say that the release of the cables was illegal, but that their theft was. Deputy leader of the opposition, Julie Bishop, said there was no room for Ms Gillard to "weasel out of it.""She is a lawyer. She well knows about the presumption of innocence," said Bishop. She added that the prime minister's legal background did not warrant her comments. Calls have also been voiced by the Green's Senator, Scott Ludlam, for Ms Gillard to retract her comments.Wikileaks has been the subject of past investigations in Australia. In March of 2009, the proposed Australian Communications and Media Authority internet blacklist was leaked to the website. That matter was also referred to the AFP, who later abandoned pursuing criminal charges."It's my understanding from the AFP that they considered the prospects of success under their guidelines, but it wasn't sufficient to get a prosecution," said Chairman Chris Chapman during a Senate Estimates Committee meeting in February. == Sources ==

[[Stella English wins sixth series of British television programme The Apprentice]]I appreciate that you have gone to lot of trouble to create this article but I feel there is something wrong with the sheer amount of coverage snow gets in the news. The thing that bugs me is that, unlike other news - nothing develops. Hour after hour of footage of a car struggling to drive up a small hill or people huddled on a platform waiting for a train that plainly isn't coming. The same format too; people struggling about a bit, a mention of some of the very worst incidents etc - some interviews with the ignorant public that seem to only be able to say 'there's no gritters, there's no gritters, there's no gritters' and then some footage of children playing. I'm sick to the teeth tbh; I have a window - I can see this all happening, I dont think it warrents being the main story every day. The on the scene correspondants don't adapt the 'terrible things are happening' tone of voice they use either. The same voice they use for cholera outbreaks in Haiti killings by a crime lord in Africa is used for this white fluffy stuff which puts everyone out a bit as if the snow ought to be combatted or something should be done by the government or the UN. Local radio tells you which schools, roads and rail lines are open or closed - this is all the information you need.Sorry about the rant if you've actually bothered to read it but I'm sick of it in the actual news and thought I may have escaped it on Wikinews. Plus I've got a lot of time on my hands - I'm snowed in!

After Griffiths was arrested by armed police on May 24, her dismembered remains were found floating the the {w|River Ayre} near {w|Shipley}; her head was in a rucksack and it was yesterday revealed a crossbow bolt and broken knife were embedded in it. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said she was in 81 pieces. Smith added that Griffiths confessed to killing her and cutting her up by hand; he had previously used power tools on his victims. Shelley Armitage, 31, had been missing since April when police charged Griffiths; a piece of spine in the River Ayre was later identified as hers. Also found by the river was a suitcase containing knives and saws.It was yesterday revealed her murder was also on video. Griffiths recorded the act on his mobile, which he then lost on a train. Its finder sold it on twice before police retrieved it, but the footage remained. Armitage is seen {w|hogtied} on cushions, the words "My Sex Slave" spray-painted in black on her back. She is also seen dead and naked in his bathtub. "I am Ven Pariah, I am the Bloodbath Artist," Griffiths said as part of a commentary to the video. "Here¡¯s a model who is assisting me."The third murder - that of Susan Rushworth, 43 - dates back to June last year, when she vanished. Although police believe she was killed with a hammer and Griffiths has spoken of the death, no remains were ever found and the only physical evidence was one bloodstain in her killer's flat. Police found evidence he tried to clean up, with bathroom tiles removed and carpets lifted. "It was just a slaughterhouse in the bathtub," he told police at interview. He later confessed to police that "I, or part of me, is responsible for killing Susan Rushworth, Shelley Armitage and Suzanne Blamires, who I know as Amber." Two crossbows, crossbow bolts, and serial killer literature were seized from his flat.The day before the final murder, Griffiths wrote on MySpace, using the Ven Pariah pseudonym, he had "finally emerged into the world." He continued: "What will this pseudo-human do, one wonders. Poor Stephen, pretended to be me, but he was only the wrapping. He knew towards the end, that I supplied the inner core of iron. Hatred Bound Tightly In Flesh. At very long last, the time has come to act out." He would later tell officers he was having a mental "civil war".He told the magistrates' court on his first appearance his name was "The Crossbow Cannibal." Yesterday, he was asked at {w|Leeds} {w|Crown Court} merely to confirm his name, answering "yes". Each murder charge was read to him, and he answered "guilty" to each. Five security guards flanked him. He has also called himself the SF killer. Although he claimed to have boiled and eaten flesh from the first two victims and eaten the third raw, police could not verify this. {w|The Telegraph} says the suspect he invented it to increase his fame, but {w|News Limited} quotes {w|Sky News} as claiming police believed his cannibalistic claims.Mr Justice Openshaw, the judge, yesterday called Griffiths "wicked and monstrous." He told the court the killer's mental health had been investigated and there is "no question that he [i]s fit to plead." He gave Griffiths the {w|whole life tariff}, meaning he will never be released.Griffiths has attempted suicide while in prison awaiting trial, and police have not yet established if he killed three more women, as he told officers his count stood at six.At the time Griffiths was charged, Nicky Blamires, 54, has told the press her daughter Suzanne was a "much-loved" family member even though she "went down the wrong path and did not have the life she was meant to have." "Nobody deserves this," she said. "All these girls were human beings and people's daughters."Griffiths was known as "the lizard man" in his block of flats owing to his habit of walking his two pet {w|monitor lizards} in the area. One neighbour is reported to have quoted him as saying he was studying for "a PhD in murder and {w|Jack the Ripper}," and he has spent time in a high-security psychiatric hospital.British media was quick to compare the case to {w|Peter Sutcliffe}, dubbed the "Yorkshire Ripper". Sutcliffe was a Bradford killer responsible for thirteen murders and seven attempted murders, including several prostitutes. Since his 1981 conviction he has spent most of the last three decades in {w|Broadmoor} high-security psychiatric hospital near London.== Sources == 
[[British Business Secretary Cable stripped of powers after 'totally unacceptable and inappropriate' comments]]British {w|Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Business Secretary} Vince Cable has tonight been reprimanded by Prime Minister David Cameron after saying he was "at war" with {w|Rupert Murdoch} over {w|News Corporation}'s attempts to take full control of {w|BSkyB}.Cable will remain in {w|Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the cabinet}, but he will have no further role in the takeover bid. A statement released by officials in {w|10 Downing Street|Downing Street} said Cable's comments were "totally unacceptable and inappropriate". The statement confirmed Cable will no longer have responsibility over matters relating to media and broadcasting.In a secret recording made by journalists from a British newspaper posing as members of the electorate, Cable said he had already decided to block the takeover bid. "I am picking my fights, some of which you may have seen, some of which you may haven't seen," he said in the recording. "I don't know if you have been following what has been happening with the Murdoch press, where I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win." In another extract from the recording, Cable says: "I have blocked it [the takeover bid], using the powers that I have got. And they are legal powers that I have got. I can't politicise it, but for the people who know what is happening, this is a big thing. His whole empire is now under attack. So there are things like that, that being in Government ... All we can do in opposition is protest."News Corporation, owned by Murdoch, owns 39% of BSkyB, but wishes to purchase the other 61% for ?7.8 billion. Cable had pledged to remain impartial in the decision, and had ordered {w|Ofcom} to investigate the takeover bid. News Corporation stated they were "shocked and dismayed" at Cable's comments, and said they "raise serious questions about fairness and due process." A source inside Downing Street said the government took "swift and firm action" in stripping Cable of his powers over the takeover bid. "He will have absolutely nothing to do with media," the source added.The business secretary apologised for his remarks, saying: "I fully accept the decision of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. I deeply regret the comments I made and apologise for the embarrassment that I have caused the Government." Political commentator {w|Nick Robinson} said although he remained in office, Cable is in a "very awkward" position, because the statement from Downing Street was, for Cable, a "humiliating slap in the face." Cable refused to answer journalists' questions as he arrived at his constituency home in {w|Twickenham}, London.== Sources ==

[[French citizens told to leave Ivory Coast as UN warns of civil war]]The French government has urged its citizens to leave the Ivory Coast as the United Nations warned that the country was heading towards a civil war. According to the U.N., there has been an increase in the use of intimidation methods by elements of the national security forces loyal to incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo."The international community must act and act decisively. I emphasize again today what I have said earlier: any attempt to starve the United Nations mission into submission will not be tolerated. Any attack on the United Nations and its staff must be considered an attack on the international community," said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. He added that the techniques of intimidation include "abductions and killings and the propagation of hate speech through the state broadcasting corporation."Meanwhile, the French government urged its citizens to leave the country. "We ask those who can, to leave Ivory Coast temporarily until the situation normalises," said {w|Francois Baroin}, a government spokesperson.On Saturday, Gbagbo ordered the U.N. and French peacekeepers to leave the country saying, "The government demands the departure of the UNOCI and LICORNE [French] forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate." Gbagbo claimed victory in the nation's elections on November 28. Alassane Ouattara won the presidential {w|run-off election} on December 3 according to the country's electoral commission. However, the Constitutional Council has contested the announcement. The French government and the U.N. have also rejected the election results. Gbagbo offered for several entities to investigate the election results, which was rejected by Ouattara who said "we've finished with these games.""I am ... ready to welcome a committee... headed by the African Union, involving ECOWAS, the Arab League, the United Nations, United States, the European Union, Russia and China, which will have permission to analyse objectively the facts of the electoral process ...to solve this crisis peacefully," Gbagbo said in a statement.The U.N. said it has no plans to leave the country saying, "the president-elect is Ouattara and he hasn't asked us to leave" and that they intend to "fulfill its mandate and will continue to monitor and document any human rights violations, incitement to hatred and violence, or attacks on U.N. peacekeepers."Also on Saturday, a U.N. convoy and the mission headquarters in {w|Abidjan} was attacked by masked gunmen in military uniforms. According to the mission, a civilian vehicle with six men inside approached the convoy. When the convoy approached the compound's entrance the gunmen opened fire. No one was injured in the attack. Shots were fired back at the gunmen, but none were hit.
[[Obama signs landmark law overturning 'don't ask, don't tell']]United States {w|President of the United States|President} Barack Obama has officially repealed the law prohibiting openly {w|homosexual} people from serving in the U.S. military. Campaigners have praised the repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" as a historic advance for gay rights. The new law was signed into effect by Obama yesterday morning. DADT, in effect for 17 years, was repealed by the United States Senate on Saturday. The military will cease enforcement of the policy in 60 days time, after the {w|The Pentagon|Pentagon} has certified to Congress that it, and the military are ready to implement the new law."This is a very good day," Obama told a crowd of soldiers and senior military officials. "This morning I'm proud to sign a law that will bring an end to 'don't ask, don't tell'. No longer will tens of thousands of Americans be asked to live a lie in order to serve the country that they love." Obama added that the government would "not drag their feet" and they were "committed to implementing this change swiftly and efficiently."He added the law would strengthen national security and the U.S. military. "No longer will our country be denied the service of thousands of patriotic Americans who were forced to leave the military, regardless of their skills, no matter their bravery or their zeal, no matter their years of exemplary performance because they happen to be gay," he said.Aubrey Sarvis, the executive director of the {w|Servicemembers Legal Defense Network}, praised the new ruling. "Clearly, this is President Obama's Lyndon Johnson moment in history," he said. "A measure of dignity has been restored to thousands of service members on active duty, and to over a million gay veterans who served in silence."Obama has been an advocate for overturning the ban on gays serving in the military. Under the law, enacted in 1993, over 13,000 members of the U.S. military have been dismissed. Supporters of DADT have said the new ruling will damage the morale of troops. Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain said earlier this month more scrutiny would be needed before the law was repealed.A report by {w|The Pentagon} earlier this month concluded most U.S. service personnel do not believe reform of the rules on gays and lesbians serving in the military would affect morale, unit cohesion or military effectiveness. The report found only 30% believed that changing the law would have a negative effect.== Sources ==

The {w|Prime Minister of Italy} said he would consider holding an election if his government failed to have a significant parliamentary majority and is unable to pass reforms by the end of January. Berlusconi only narrowly survived a {w|vote of no confidence} in the {w|Parliament of Italy|Italian parliament} a week ago, and he is facing a backlash from students over plans to radically reform the university system.Berlusconi said he had conferred with officials in {w|Legran Nord|Lega Nord}, his government's main ally, which has stressed elections are the most promising end to the political crisis in Italy, which began when when a split occurred in Berlusconi's party, {w|The People of Freedom}. "If, in contrast to what we expect, we do not have a sufficient majority to govern at the end of January, I think that the best thing would be to have the chance to get a fresh majority in both houses of parliament," Berlusconi told journalists. However, there is skepticism that even if Berlusconi wanted to hold an election, he would be unable to. {w|President of Italy|President} {w|Giorgio Napolitano} has insisted dissolving parliament is a last resort. Berlusconi won the vote of no confidence last week by only three votes. The {w|Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies} voted to keep Burlusconi in power by 314 votes to 311.

[[Scottish politician going to jail after perjury conviction]]Tommy Sheridan, a former Member of the Scottish {w|Scottish Parliament|Parliament}, has been told to expect a prison sentence in the new year. Sheridan was yesterday convicted of {w|perjury} before Glasgow High Court, the jury ruling he lied in a libel case against {w|The News of the World}. Sheridan, 46, sued the paper in 2006 over allegations he had been in extra-marital affairs, visited a sex club and participated in orgies. He was awarded {w|pound sterling|?}200,000. Thought to be the longest-running perjury trial in Scotland's history, the twelve-week case started with Sheridan facing eighteen allegations. By the end of the trial, he faced six in a single charge; the jury ruled he was guilty of five of them. His wife Gail, 46, was also charged but this was dropped by the prosecution as part of proceedings.The case dates back to 2004, when the NotW ran a series of articles. Central to these were claims he had visited Manchester sex club Cupids. He would later claim in court he had not confessed to former friends about these visits, but the jury decided yesterday this was a lie. They said he was also lying when he said he did not have an affair with Katrine Trolle, a former activist with the {w|Scottish Socialist Party}. Trolle claimed they had sex in the Sheridan marital bed at their Glasgow home, but the jury did not accept this part of the allegation.The jury cleared him totally of lying when he said he did not have an affair with Anvar Khan, a NotW columnist whose memoirs sparked the original reports. The relationship was alleged to have begun in 1994 and carried on until 2003; Tommy and Gail married in 2000.A former friend of Tommy Sheridan, {w|George McNeilage}, made a tape recording said to be of Sheridan admitting visits to Cupids. Sheridan claimed it was faked. Conducting his own defence after releasing his counsel, {w|Maggie Scott}, QC, within two weeks of the trial starting, he said there was a "vendetta" against him. Several SSP members said he had confessed to affairs. Sheridan also provided his own counsel in his successful libel action, which is now being appealed against.Trial judge {w|Lord Bracadale} is seeking background reports prior to sentencing, which will be on January 26. Sheridan can make any submissions he wishes to then. "You have been convicted of the serious offence of perjury," Lord Bracadale told Sheridan "and must return to court expecting to begin a prison sentence.""We have an appeal lodged against that defamation verdict and we now look forward to that appeal succeeding in Scotland's {w|Court of Session}," the paper said in respect of the libel action. NotW has paid ?200,000 for the tape of Sheridan's confession that was used in the trial."I have and will always stand by Tommy," vowed his wife.== Sources ==

[[Boat sinks off New Jersey coast killing one]]Buddpaulasks, "Is everyone awake?" Some articles have been waiting to be published for a while now..... too long, and are getting stale --User:Buddpaul 03:11, 3 September 2010Hi. I've seen similar posts in the archive of watercooler to what Im going to ask... I'm new, made my first article and have tried to fix the reviewers comments but now it sits doing nothing with nobody reviewing it for about 36 hours now. The article is "Wikileaks distributes website content". Is it being abandoned due to disliking the topic/content, difficult to review or simply too much passing through. Was really looking forward to participating but this is slowly putting me off, hope can get some feedback soon. Thanks Terado 02:00, 9 December 2010I've fucked this up really spectacularly; somebody needs to clean up the mess.I've left the article in a {tl|review} state, where it should have been all along, but it was {tl|publish}ed for almost two hours.  Rockerball had attempted to publish but EPR didn't edit the article, and I found it that way a few hours later and "fixed" it but failed to notice that some of the edits had been made ¡ªI think¡ª just after the passing publication action.  So I published some unreviewed edits.I'm going to walk away from the project for a few hours, before I do more damage.  --Pi zero 17:59, 10 December 2010Not sure what's going on with all the reviewers... or if the problem is that the sources are in Spanish, but please review my article Body undiscovered for a decade found in Pichilemu, Chile before it gets stale! Please! Diego Grez return fire 15:34, 14 December 2010I've just updated the World News Quiz but it seems that it is not appearing on the World News Quiz page. Here is my quiz. If anyone could fix the issue or tell me what's going on, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks, ~YTT ? 06:37, 18 December 2010What are the chances that I could receive accreditation under the criteria listed at the WN:Accreditation policy page, but using the "Or a contributor to another Wikimedia Foundation project who is in good standing there" and "or, a corpus of quality contributions elsewhere on Wikimedia Foundation projects" parts of the criteria? I have only written one article on Wikinews at the moment, so I would need to acquire it under that part of the criteria. I would want the accreditation mostly for photojournalism, rather than article writing, so that I could take and upload photos of news and events that could be used on Wikinews or elsewhere. I notice in reviewing recent requests that there don't seem to be many primarily photojournalism-based requests or requests based on contributions to other projects, so I thought I would come ask here how likely a request would be to succeed were I to make one. Note: Most of my contributions are to English Wikipedia, followed by Commons, so those are the two projects on which I would base my request off of.Thanks in advance, Ks0stm 21:58, 16 December 2010An admin might like to look at Shakti kumar which seems to be a promotional/ advertising attempt with zero news content.

[[December blizzard slams Northeastern United States]]The United States' first major blizzard of the winter season has left much of the {w|New England} region covered in snow. Stretching from Virginia to Maine, the storm, packing winds of over 50 miles per hour, dropped more than two feet of snow in some areas. Residents prepared for what would be one of the worst nor'easters in quite some time. The storm contained similar conditions to a category 2 hurricane. Wellfleet, Massachusetts saw an 80 miles per hour wind gust, the strongest recorded throughout the storm. Connecticut, New York and Maine all recorded wind gusts of over 60 miles per hour and gusts of over 70 miles per hour blasted Cape Cod.A total of 32 inches fell in {w|Rahway, New Jersey|Rahway}, part of the hardest-hit state in the storm's path. Most New Jersey cities received over a foot of snow, while Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and Maryland all had snow totals topping out at around 1 foot with Massachusetts topping out at a foot and a half.On Monday, travel proved difficult, with flights from Philadelphia, {w|Newark, New Jersey|Newark}, New York City, {w|Hartford}, Boston, {w|Portland, Maine|Portland}, and Washington, D.C. canceled. Drivers also ran into problems on major highways as accidents were unavoidable on the slick roads. 
[[Gunman dies, police officer injured after stand-off ends in West Yorkshire, England]]A gunman has been killed and a police officer hospitalised following a stand-off in West Yorkshire, England which concluded this morning. The gunman, who, according to police, "continually" fired at officers, sustained serious injuries after police returned fire; he died in hospital.Police attended a property in {w|Kirkheaton}, {w|Huddersfield} yesterday, to arrest a man for allegedly threatening a person at a nearby property. Upon their arrival, the man inside fired with a handgun from his doorstep at police, injuring one officer. Armed police then surrounded the building.Reports suggest the gunman fired on police throughout the stand-off, which involved negotiators. Around 0530 {w|GMT} armed police returned fire, seriously injuring the gunman. He was transported to hospital where he later died. "There were three loud bangs¡ªpossibly gunfire," a news cameraman said. "Then the police started shouting and I heard them smashing glass as they went into the house. They were shouting at the gunman to show them his hands."A spokesperson for {w|West Yorkshire Police} confirmed the stand-off had come to an end. "The man produced a gun and fired at the officers. A male officer in his 20s was hit and attended hospital for minor injuries," he said. "We regret that the incident at the house did not conclude peacefully as we had hoped and can confirm that the man taken to hospital from the address has now died."The road remains closed as the investigation continues. Neighbours said they were shocked; one said about eight or nine shots were fired throughout the night. "The police then just told us to stay inside but I could see what was going on opposite," he said. "Loads of police turned up¡ªsome carrying machine guns. They lit the house up like a Christmas tree and the armed police were behind hedges." The {w|Independent Police Complaints Commission} is to investigate.== Sources ==

[[U.S. Supreme Court]]A report by the Chinese government states {w|Corruption in the People's Republic of China|corruption} is "very serious". Officials, it says, have investigated over 240,000 cases in the past seven years including {w|bribery} and {w|embezzlement}.The document, released by state news agency {w|Xinhua}, states although "notable" steps have been made towards fighting corruption, attempts to flush out corrupt citizens need to be more effective. The report further warns of corruption within government, noting new regulations ordering government officials to report investment and income. It also praises the Internet and the {w|News media|media} for exposing corruption. In recent years China has launched several campaigns against corrupt practices, but a Chinese anti-corruption researcher told Xinhua the report indicated the Chinese government now have "a more open and cooperative attitude toward the problem."There have been several high profile cases of corruption in the country over the past several years; this year the highest ranking justice official in {w|Chongqing}, {w|Wen Qiang}, was executed for accepting bribes, shielding criminal gangs and rape, and in 2008 a powerful party boss was jailed for 18 years for involvement in a {w|pension fund} scandal.Although the report notes efforts have been taken to stamp down on corruption in China, it adds ridding it completely will be difficult. "Since the relevant mechanisms and systems are still incomplete, corruption persists, with some cases even involving huge sums of money," it states. "The situation in combating corruption is still very serious, and the tasks are still abundant."== Sources == 
[[Memorial service held for model found dead in Missouri mansion]]A memorial service was held Thursday for Adrienne Nicole Martin, the model found dead two weeks ago in the Missouri, US mansion of former {w|Anheuser-Busch} CEO {w|August Busch IV}. Martin, of Native American ethnicity, was 27 years old when she died of unknown causes, said investigators.Martin, who had been dating the 46-year-old Busch for "the last several months" according to friends, was a native of {w|Springfield, Missouri|Springfield}. She had previously been married to 45-year-old doctor Kevin J. Martin until February 2009, when they divorced, and had joint custody of their eight-year-old son. Adrienne Martin had a profile on iStudio, a modeling website, where she said she wanted to become an {w|art therapy|art therapist}. She also expressed a desire to "to do beer advertising" and work in the modeling industry. At the time of her death, Martin had been working toward a master's degree in art therapy.The memorial service for Martin was held at South Haven Baptist Church in Springfield. Busch was not among the estimated 100 people attending the service, nor was he mentioned during it. The only speaker was the church's pastor, Scott Watson, who read letters from Martin's friends. Her son and other relatives sat in the front row while she was remembered as a gifted artist and dedicated mother. Lacy Elet, one of Martin's friends, later said Martin was happy that "her life was finally in order." Her obituary in the {w|Springfield News-Leader} called Busch "the love of her life." However, one of Martin's uncles, Andy Eby, said after the service, "There are too many questions and not enough answers."Martin was found unconscious by Michael Jung, who worked at Busch's mansion, at 12:30 p.m. {w|Central Standard Time|local time} on December 19. At 1:12 p.m., Jung called emergency services, saying, "This girl's just not waking up." When asked if she was breathing, Jung responded with, "We don't know. It's dark back there. I'm gonna get a light and try and see." At 1:26 p.m., Martin was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency workers. Law enforcement officials said the room was dark because there were blackout "curtains drawn in the bedroom."An {w|autopsy} on Martin's body did not find any trauma-related injuries, and the official cause of death has not been established by investigators. A {w|toxicology} report, expected to take several weeks, will likely be used to determine the reason Martin died. Police said Martin's body did not exhibit any "apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death." According to her ex-husband, Adrienne Martin had a rare heart condition, called {w|Long QT syndrome}, which can cause {w|palpitation|palpitations} and {w|sudden cardiac death}. Kevin Martin said his ex-wife never sought medical advice on her condition and did not talk about it with friends.Police said that Busch was home at the {w|US$}2 million mansion when Martin was discovered, and that the ongoing investigation is being handled by the {w|Frontenac, Missouri|Frontenac} Police Department and the {w|St. Louis County} Medical Examiner's Office. Art Margulis, a lawyer for August Busch IV, said Martin was visiting the {w|Huntleigh, Missouri|Huntleigh} residence and that there is "absolutely nothing suspicious" surrounding her death.== Sources ==

[[James Cameron]]Hi everyone. Could anybody write article about this event. We have some pictures in Commons: commons:Category:GLAM Wiki UK 2010. Some info is here. BTW - do you want translation of the Sabat - meeting of sister projects editors :pl:W Poznaniu odby?o si? robocze spotkanie projekt¨®w Wikimedia? Przykuta 21:28, 29 November 2010What's up with all of you? Wikinews has been stagnant for long. I don't really know what are the reasons, but I'm seeing the same leads in the main page. Don't you like to write now? Or are the reviewers taking too much time to review every article? That may be the reason why Wikinews is not working well, I say. We have to correct this now:Or:If you love Wikinews as I do, I'm sure you will choose one option or the other. I haven't got the time to come here and review or write articles, I have too much homework at school, and I really need to get concentrated on real life things, rather than to stay the entire day in front of a computer. Thank you all. Diego Grez return fire 19:45, 17 November 2010Something really does need to be done about the review times. Some articles are left to be reviewed hours after they have had a request placed. In the end, the article ends up being published up to days after the event has occurred. I do understand also that the time that an article takes to be published is heavily reliant on the author and the quality of the article but it would be great to see some faster reviews occurring. Really, reviewer status should only be granted to the most active members of WN who contribute consistent quantities articles. I also think the reminder system may assist is sifting through who are the active reviewers and who aren't. Thanks ~YTT 05:44, 12 December 2010How about this being subst'd onto inactive reviewer talk pages. If no reaction in a couple of weeks, follow up with an email. --Brian McNeil / talk 14:08, 20 November 2010As a new user of Wikinews, I originally had some trouble developing articles and made many mistakes. So, just as a rough outline, I have created this -http://filesmelt.com/dl/Wikinews_Synthesis_Article_Template.pdf. It is a template for people to create a synthesis article and I think it would help people who are new to Wikinews to create a synthesis article with fewer mistakes. Currently it is in .pdf format but it would be distributed in .doc so it can be edited. Any feedback and/or changes you think would be appropriate would be much appreciated. Thanks, ~YTT 08:19, 15 December 2010Looking at you inverted pyramid diagram, generally, the lead section is limited to only the "Who, What, Where, When, and How," with the Why saved for a later paragraph. From what I recall, this is because the Why is less important than the others. The style guide says, "Put the most important and newsworthy facts first, with least important and least immediate facts last."You organized things so it's five paragraphs. Most articles are varied in legnth. Compare this and this. They are six and three paragraphs respectively. I think you should reorganize the pyramid. The lead should have the basic facts that if someone reads just that, they should at least be able to give those basics to anyone who asks them if there heard about that. Then following facts ordered in most important to least. Since paragraphs vary in length, you should keep that in mind if you redo the pyramid.Hope that helps, and thanks for that PDF. ¡ªMikemoral?? 01:26, 16 December 2010 LOOK BELOW for updated versionAs before, any suggestions would be appreciated. If there is anything you want to change, make sure you tell me so I can apply it to the master. Thanks, ~YTT ? 03:33, 16 December 2010Okay, I hope this is the final version. If anything is wrong, though, tell me and I'll edit the master. Could any administrators also tell me if it could/is ready to be implemented as documentation in its current form? I have a .pdf and a .doc available, would both be appropriate for distribution? Thanks, ~YTT ? 06:41, 16 December 2010Given that Wikinews is in a bit of a rut at the moment, and as an idea I've been toying with for quite some time, I've floated the idea of starting, and developing, a Wikinews reporters' workshop series of sessions. Ideally, this would be three or four sessions of three hours each, carried out in a library or other civic facility.I've been cultivating the staff of Fountainbridge library in Edinburgh, including donating my copies of Private Eye to their available periodicals once I've read them. I'm fairly confident I could get a couple of the staff to back me up in persuading the council to give their PC lab for the required time to do a course.Below are my seat-of-the-pants notes on what I think is required. Please add as appropriate.I can, trivially, put up fliers in most of Edinburgh's libraries. The proposed text is at-issue. I favour using my enWN tagline as the headline; "Facts don't cease to be facts, but news ceases to be news."Then, a short intro to Wikinews, a simple URL to an on-project landing page, and a wikinewsie email address for people to express interest and sign up.We're talking a class size of about 16 - Fountainbridge has no WiFi facilities. One successful run might get me more facilities, and interest from Napier college.To start with, I'd want a 'pack' to email to the interested. From there, we encourage to do the sign-up on-wiki after creating an account and getting a preemptive caution on what is news, what might be good reading material, and so on. This whittles out a lot of people who might be curious, but not follow through; don't want to waste time teaching how to create an account, or the real basics of wiki editing.By the last 'workshop' I'd want to be introducing OR, daring the more ambitious to interview local councillors, or hit the street when they hear sirens, get to the scene, photograph stuff, and ask emergency services about the situation.During, and shortly after, each class it would be essential that our established reviewers are available, and giving informative feedback. By the end of the course, I'd want to see 20%+ of those completing it nommed for reviewer.So, I'm listing a few books I'd want on the recommended reading list. Feel free to add.Reading listWhat, I think, is important is that any recommended stuff is in the library collection, or available online.What do people think? Edinburgh's libraries run a few courses on blogging; I'm of the opinion getting published on Wikinews would be more satisfying, complimentary to that, and a start on building a more stable contributor base city-by-city. --Brian McNeil / talk 22:16, 16 December 2010

In a statement, Obama said: "We will never forget the selfless courage demonstrated by the firefighters, police officers and first responders who risked their lives to save others. I believe this is a critical step for those who continue to bear the physical scars of those attacks."The law was the only one that passed through Congress during the lame-duck session in December, with some Republican opposition. New York Senators and Congressmen have praised the passage of the measures."The heroes who rushed to Ground Zero in the hours and days after the attacks will not be forgotten. These first responders were like veterans, and this law keeps with a time-honored tradition of standing by our veterans when they get harmed answering the call." said {w|Charles Schumer|Charles Schumer}, Democratic Senator from New York. He also vowed to "begin work immediately to make sure this law gets renewed for another five years".New York Republican congressman {w|Peter T.

[[European Space Agency]]Hi. I'm concerned presently about the Wikinews Welcome bot. I understand it's a mediawiki option, but I don't like the fact it just goes round randomly welcoming everyone without waiting.  I indef blocked a user about 20 minutes ago called "URAFUCKENNOOB". The account had already been welcomed by Wikinews Welcome, and I think the action of this welcome, followed by an admin basically turning up with a big hammer and hitting the user with it looks very two faced.  It's like we're being polite on one hand, and punching them in the happy sack with the other.  I'd like to suggest that we give the bot a cooling off period - wait until the user has at least 1 edit, and if they haven't been blocked within 2 hours from that edit, then and only then, do they get welcomed by the bot.In my eyes, it makes much more sense and seems a lot nicer to users to have them welcomed after they start contributing sensibly, than a generic welcome from a bot, before we kick them into another postcode for something like an offensive username.

[[Ivory Coast expels British, Canadian ambassadors]]The incumbent leader of the Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, is expelling the Canadian and British ambassadors, according to state television.State television reports the envoys are being expelled as a reciprocal measure, as the respective countries did not recognise Gbagbo's leadership. This is following his decision not to step down despite international recognition of rival Alassane Ouattara winning the November 2010 presidential election. Canada withdrew recognition of Louis L.B. Bony ¡ª Gbagbo's ambassador to Canada ¡ª on December 29, with the United Kingdom following suit on December 31. In addition, France, the former colonial power of the Ivory Coast, has stated that it will recognise Ouattara's appointee, as has the United Nations.Although the ambassadors have been expelled, their diplomatic privileges will not be revoked until such time as they leave the Ivory Coast.Outtara, who won 54% of the vote, which was backed by the United Nations and the country's Electoral Commission, remains under protection by UN peacekeepers, in a hotel in the main city and former capital of Abidjan.The Foreign Office of the United Kingdom issued a travel warning in force for the Ivory Coast last month, advising British nationals to "leave by commercial means, if safe to do so", due to the threat of "widespread instability in Abidjan and other major cities. The Foreign Office [of the UK] continues to advise against all travel to Cote d'Ivoire". In a separate incident, the United States announced that US citizens were to be barred from dealing financially with Gbagbo, and that the assets of Gbagbo, his wife and three aides, had been frozen. Gbagbo retains control of the state army and media.== Sources == 
[[Former CIA agent indicted after leaking classified information]]Jeffrey Alexander Sterling, an ex-officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, was taken into custody Thursday by federal agents in {w|St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis}, Missouri. He was indicted on six separate counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, as well as four additional charges: {w|mail fraud}, unlawfully keeping national defense information, {w|obstruction of justice}, and unauthorized conveyance of government property. Sterling, aged 43, had been employed by the CIA from May 1993 until he was fired in January 2002. During his {w|arraignment}, a judge declared that he would be held until a Monday hearing because the government called him a danger to the community.Sterling, an African American lawyer who lives in {w|O'Fallon, Missouri|O'Fallon}, allegedly provided classified information to {w|New York Times} reporter {w|James Risen}, some of which was incorporated into Risen's 2006 {w|State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration}. Risen, who wrote about the CIA's involvement in Iran's nuclear program, has not named any of his sources even after being {w|subpeona|subpeonaed} twice; Risen was not explicitly named in Sterling's indictment, but his involvement in the alleged leak is strongly supported by its contents, and a US government official confirmed the connection to {w|NBC News}.The indictment stated that, for two years during his career with the CIA, Sterling had been involved in "a classified clandestine operational program designed to conduct intelligence activities related to the weapons capabilities of certain countries." An anonymous source close to the investigation said one of those countries was Iran. While managing CIA operations, Sterling also handled a "human asset," whose name he is also accused of releasing.From 2000, Sterling had been engaged in various disputes with the agency. According to a story authored by Risen for The New York Times in March 2002, Sterling's supervisor during the Iran program said, "You kind of stick out as a big black guy." The comment was made after Sterling made requests for new assignments concerning Iran, requests declined because his appearance could interfere with the cases. Sterling, sued the CIA  for racial discrimination shortly after being fired, but was unable to come to a settlement in February 2003, and allegedly began leaking the classified information soon after that. The indictment claimed the motive behind the leak was retaliation for the unsuccessful lawsuit.Edward B. MacMahon Jr., a Virginia attorney for Sterling, said, "He has always maintained his innocence throughout the course of this entire investigation. We'll seek to prove that in court." MacMahon also said trial will be held at a {w|U.S. District Court} in Alexandria, as the case began in that state. Every charge against Sterling comes with the possibility of 10¨C20 years of jail time.The {w|Obama administration} has already taken action in several similar leaks involving government officers. The administration has also initiated an investigation into Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, after the site's release of thousands of classified documents.
[[Seventeen dead in Afghan bathhouse bombing]]An Afghani suicide bomber killed seventeen people Friday in the southeastern town of {w|Spin Boldak}, Afghanistan.  The bomb was detonated in a bathhouse Friday afternoon as bystanders conducted their ritual {w|Ritual purification|prayer-washing}. An additional 23 people were wounded in the midday bombing that left sixteen civilians and one police officer dead.  The Taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.  A spokesman for the Taliban, Qari Yousaf Ahmadi, stated the attack was targeted at the second-in-command of a border patrol force in southern Afghanistan.  Afghanistan's leader, Hamid Karzai, condemned the attack, as did NATO and US leaders. Karzai's administration has been both fighting the Taliban as well as trying to lure them to the negotiating table.  The US Embassy in Afghanistan issued a statement calling the bombing a "callous terrorist act."  US President Barack Obama plans to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by 2014.  == Sources == 
[[BBC receives 8,400 complaints over 'EastEnders' cot death story]]Some 8,400 complaints have been made to the BBC and 374 complaints have been received by {w|Ofcom}, a British media regulator, after soap opera {w|EastEnders} broadcasted what {w|BBC News Online} described as the "cot death storyline".The storyline involves character {w|Ronnie Branning} ¨C portrayed by {w|Samantha Womack} ¨C taking her baby, who experienced {w|sudden infant death syndrome}, and exchanging for another living baby, {w|Alfie Moon|Alfie} and {w|Kat Moon}'s recently born son. The plot has caused the largest number of complaints to be made about the show since it was first broadcast in 1985.Campaigners attempting to raise awareness of SIDS criticised the plot. {w|Anne Diamond}, a television presenter and one of those campaigners, remarked that the exchange of the babies was a "crass twist to an otherwise credible storyline" and said that not "one iota of good in educating a young audience about cot death" had been achieved by it.Due to the complaints received, the BBC have made the decision to end this storyline earlier than originally scheduled, during the spring of 2011. {w|Bryan Kirkwood|Bryan Kirkwood}, the current executive producer of EastEnders, has disclosed that, at the end of this storyline, the baby, named Tommy, will remeet Kat Moon, his mother. {QuoteLeft|Although we have had complaints we have also had positive responses from people who have been through the experiences we are currently dramatising who feel we've done this and have contacted us to offer their backing.|source={{w|Bryan Kirkwood|Bryan Kirkwood}, {w|EastEnders} executive producer}}Kirkwood said that this storyline, like many others in the {w|BBC One} programme, approaches "social issues in a powerful and dramatic way". He also explained: "Although we have had complaints we have also had positive responses from people who have been through the experiences we are currently dramatising who feel we've done this and have contacted us to offer their backing."Whenever we embark on a story at EastEnders we always leave it open-ended to monitor and listen to audience reaction," he continued. "With this in mind we are going to bring the story to a close on screen in the spring. As the story progresses and Kat is reunited with her child, we hope to explore the impact of the tragic events that have befallen the characters in a way that is powerful, but true to the best public service tradition of the show."Justine Roberts, the {w|chief executive officer} and founder of British community website {w|Mumsnet}, created a letter of complaint for {w|Mark Thompson}, {w|Director-General of the BBC}. "The focus of the complaint is the swapping story line," the letter reads. "Our members are concerned that, as is all too common, a bereaved mother has been portrayed as deranged and unhinged." {HYS question right|Do you think that a storyline like this is unsuitable for broadcast?}In response to the Mumsnet letter, {w|Jana Bennett}, director of vision at the BBC, stated that this plot was managed in a manner that was "sensitively handled". She stressed that "[t]he show is absolutely not suggesting that this behaviour is typical of a mother who has suffered such a terrible and tragic loss."Taking Kat's baby is the action of a character in great distress due to a series of events that have befallen her in the last 18 months," Bennett explained. "It is the culmination of these that has driven her to this one moment of madness rather than as a direct result of the loss of her baby. The issues of grief caused by the loss of a child and sudden infant death syndrome more generally are sensitively handled. EastEnders has a long history of tackling difficult issues in a way that allows viewers to learn and debate the topic at hand."On Thursday, Samantha Womack denied that this storyline was the reason for her leaving the programme. She has mentioned that her departure had already been arranged with producers of the programme for a few months.Before this incident occurred, the record for the highest number of complaints for EastEnders was a storyline in April 2009 that involved {w|Danielle Jones|Danielle Jones} being killed as the result of a car collision. That storyline received in excess of 7,000 complaints.== Sources ==

Greenwood and his team of researchers studied in particular the variations of hydrogen in the mineral apatite.The newfound data show that the chemical properties of water in the apatite samples resemble data from the comets {w|Comet Hale-Bopp|Hale-Bopp}, {w|Halley's Comet|Halley}, and {w|Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake}, suggesting that the water present on the moon could have originated from these comets or others.According to Greenwood, the results of this study could also provide evidence as to the origin of water on Earth.== Sources == 
[[Former US Congressman Tom DeLay sentenced to three years in prison]]A Texas judge handed down a three-year prison sentence today to Tom DeLay, former US {w|House Majority Leader}.  The sentence is a follow-up to a conviction in November of {w|money laundering} and {w|conspiracy} charges committed in 2002. DeLay, a right-wing {w|Republican}, was considered one of the most influential congressman in the history of the United States House of Representatives.  The sentence handed down by Judge Pat Priest was originally 8 years behind bars. However, DeLay was allowed to deduct 5 years for the money laundering charge, in exchange for 10 years of {w|community service}. DeLay's {w|bail} was set at $10,000 while his appeal is pending.  In November, DeLay was convicted of funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to other Texas politicians. Although DeLay was found guilty, he denies all charges of misconduct. "Judge, I can't be remorseful for something I don't think I did," he said.  The prosecuting attorney, Steve Brandt said this non-remorseful sentiment should be cause for more prison time: "He has shown no remorse, no remorse whatsoever...He needs to go to prison, your honor, and he needs to go today."== Sources == 
[[Tucson gunman appears in court for Giffords shooting]]Jared Loughner, a 22-year-old former college student, has appeared in federal court following the shooting on Saturday at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. The shooting killed five people including {w|John Roll}, a federal judge, and injured 19 including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.Loughner has been charged in federal court with attempted assassination of a member of Congress, {w|Murder|first-degree murder} and attempting to kill employees of the federal government. Prosecutors for the State of Arizona are trying to determine whether they can bring charges for the other killings and attempted killings in state court.Loughner confirmed his identity to the court and was denied bail but did not enter a plea. He stated that he understood the potential punishment for the charges include the death penalty or life imprisonment. He is being represented by {w|Judy Clarke}, who has previously defended {w|Theodore Kaczynski} and {w|Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber} {w|Timothy McVeigh}.Surgeons have had to perform emergency surgery on Giffords, including a {w|hemicraniectomy}, which involves removing a large section of her skull to reduce the pressure from the swelling in the brain caused by the gunshot wound. Dr. Michael Lemole, one neurosurgeon operating on Giffords said that she was "not out of the woods yet". He also noted that "swelling can sometimes take three days or five days to maximize. But every day that goes by and we don't see an increase, we're slightly more optimistic." Giffords has been able to respond to basic commands from doctors like holding up two fingers.Meanwhile, debates rage following allegations that Loughner had a political basis for his attack. {w|Pima County, Arizona|Pima County} Sheriff Clarence Dupnik blamed some extreme rhetoric in the media. "The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous.

[[Release of 'Verizon iPhone' set for early February]]In a Tuesday media event, {w|Verizon Wireless} announced it had reached an agreement with Apple Inc. and would begin selling a {w|CDMA} version of the {w|iPhone 4} beginning early February. The move means the end of rival company {w|AT&T}'s status as the only official US carrier of the iPhone, a status it held since the first iPhone debuted in 2007.The press conference, held in New York City, was hosted by Verizon's president, {w|Lowell McAdam}, Apple's chief operating officer, {w|Tim Cook}, and Verizon Wireless' chief executive officer, {w|Dan Mead}. Neither {w|Verizon Communications} CEO {w|Ivan Seidenberg} nor Apple CEO Steve Jobs attended the conference. During the event, McAdam said, "If the press writes something long enough and hard enough, it eventually comes true. We're bringing the fruit of our labor with a giant partner, and that's Apple." Such a partnership had been rumored for years, and the amount of speculation grew over the past few months.iPhone 4 pre-orders for current Verizon users begin February 3, and a public release is scheduled for February 10. The "Verizon iPhone," as it has been dubbed for months, has been altered from the original iPhone 4 so it can utilize Verizon's {w|3G} CDMA network. This means, however, that Verizon iPhone users will not be able to use the company's {w|4G} {w|LTE Advanced|LTE} network, and will thus be unable to make calls and access the Internet at the same time. Cook told the audience that the LTE hardware was not ready yet, saying, "The first generation LTE chip sets force some design compromises, some of which we would not make. Secondly¡ªand most importantly¡ªVerizon Wireless customers have told us they want the iPhone now." However, Verizon's iPhone 4 allows the user to create a {w|Personal hotspot|personal Wi-Fi hotspot}, which means up to five other wireless devices can connect to the Internet through the phone.Pricing was announced as {w|US$}199 for a 16 {w|gigabyte|GB} version and US$299 for a 32 GB version, both requiring two-year contracts¡ªthe same cost for an AT&T iPhone 4. However, Verizon said it would not mention the cost of data plans at this time, with Mead saying, "We talked about the device pricing, but we're not going to talk about the pricing for the network for that connectivity."== Sources ==

[[Burma introduces military draft]]According to an official document, the Burmese {w|junta} has passed a law dated November 4, 2010, requiring able-bodied persons over the age of 18 to register with local authorities. Furthermore, the law requires all men between the ages 18 and 45 as well as all women between 18 to 35 to join the army if they are called upon.  Those who fail to report for military service could be imprisoned for three years, and face fines. Those who deliberately inflict injury upon themselves to avoid {w|conscription} could be imprisoned for up to five years, as well as fines.  Civil servants, students, those serving prison terms, and those caring for an elderly parent are currently excluded from the draft, but they could be later called to serve. Totally exempt are members of religious orders, disabled persons, and married or divorced women with children.The {w|Democratic Voice of Burma} claims that the law was passed just before the new parliament convened in order to avoid scrutiny of the practice by the new parliament.  However, laws surrounding forcible conscription are murky and it is unclear how tightly the new law would be enforced.The new law has faced stiff criticism by Burmese around the world. Aung Kyaw Zaw, a military analyst on the China-Burma border, said that there are pros and cons to the new law. "From the bad side, our country is already in deep poverty and the people barely have anything to eat. So [adopting such a law] may cause bigger negative effects on the country, which is already¡­struggling to feed the current army and carry the burden of military expenses.""On the plus side, civilians will learn how to use guns and be given a chance to understand the nature of the military. With the knowledge of how to handle weapons, the people will be able to rise up against the military ¨C in a way they will be trained for the revolution."Many people see the draft as a threat to ethnic armed groups, who have been long embroiled in guerrilla conflicts with the government.Burma is a military dictatorship and already has a standing army close to half a million, one of the biggest per capita in the world.  Previously, professionals, including doctors, engineers and mechanics, between the ages of 18 and 44, and females between 18 to 33, were required to serve in the military for up to three years.  However, the new law extends this to five years in case of a national emergency.== Sources ==

A press and publicity campaign has been running since October and has included television, radio and bus adverts to let people know if they are in an at-risk group, and that the vaccine is available free of charge to those groups from GPs. We have also encouraged health boards and GPs to ensure that their patients and front line NHS staff are vaccinated against seasonal flu."Throughout the United Kingdom, 62 individuals reportedly died in the last week, as the result of suffering from influenza.

[[Two children die after contracting H1N1 virus in Northern Ireland]]The second boy had underlying health difficulties. It is unknown if the first had other problems with his health. Since the start of the flu season in the United Kingdom, the total number of deaths in Northern Ireland as a result of contracting the H1N1 virus has now increased to 19. At least two of those 19 dead had other underlying health issues.Following these incidents, Dr. Michael McBride, {w|Chief Medical Officer|Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland}, is attempting to reassure the parents of children that are in good health. "We continue to offer vaccinations to any child under five in an at risk group as advised by the joint committee. The question has been posed if we should extend to healthy under-5s. I know the {w|Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation|JCVI} is keeping this under close and active review and we will continue to be guided by their expert advice."Michael McGimpsey pointed out that he acknowledges the anxiety that young childrens' parents may be experiencing. "I have recently spoken to other UK health ministers about Northern Ireland's current flu picture," he explained. "I have also spoken to Mary Harney, the Republic of Ireland's health minister. In addition, I have consulted with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about the particular circumstances here. They do not recommend extending the vaccination programme beyond the current at risk groups."== Sources == 
[[Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs on medical leave]]Steve Jobs, the chief executive officer of Apple Inc., announced Monday in an internal memo that he would be on medical leave for an undetermined period of time. The statement caused a sharp decrease of Apple {w|share price|share prices} in foreign markets, while US markets were closed in honor of {w|Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Martin Luther King}.Monday's email announcement marked the third time in the past decade that Jobs, aged 55, has taken medical leave. He fought {w|pancreatic cancer} in 2004 and took six months off in early 2009, later revealing he had undergone a liver transplant. Jobs has not yet mentioned what prompted his decision this time around, but said he will still be the company's CEO. He left current chief operating officer {w|Timothy D. Cook} in charge of day-to-day operations, the same move made in Jobs' last two absences.While no additional comment has been officially made by Apple, {w|The New York Times} reported that someone familiar with the situation said Jobs's health has "ups and downs" due to problems with his {w|immune system}, problems frequently experienced by those who have had liver transplants. The insider, who asked to remain anonymous, said that, over the past few weeks, Jobs' health appeared to be deteriorating and that he was becoming thinner. Lewis W. Teperman, a doctor at {w|New York University}, said, "It¡¯s very common for transplant patients to have issues that are not life-threatening."On its website, Apple released the text of Jobs's email, which reads:  Team,At my request, the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence so I can focus on my health. I will continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company.I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for all of Apple's day to day operations. I have great confidence that Tim and the rest of the executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we have in place for 2011.I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can. In the meantime, my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy.Steve == Sources == 
[[NASA astronaut Tim Kopra, crew member of upcoming mission, sustains injury]]NASA astronaut Tim Kopra, a crew member on the upcoming {w|STS-133} Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station, sustained an injury in a bicycle accident over the weekend, possibly breaking his hip. His injury could create difficulties for him, the lead {w|Extra-vehicular activity|space-walker} on the STS-133 mission, and the rest of the crew in their training for the mission. The mission is currently scheduled to launch on February 24.Although Kopra is expected to make a full recovery from his injury, NASA says there is a possibility that his duties on the upcoming mission to the ISS could be modified. "Mission Specialist Tim Kopra was injured Saturday in a bicycle accident, but he will be OK. There could be an impact to his duties for shuttle Discovery's STS-133 mission to the International Space Station.

The two leaders spoke about {w|Sino-American relations|relations between their countries}.Topics included human rights, trade between the US and China, and climate change. Obama noted that China's position on human rights was occasionally a "source of tension," although  it did not "prevent [the U.S. and China] from cooperating."Standing next to each other at the White House, the pair took questions from reporters on the scene. One asked how "[the US can work with] a country known for treating its people so poorly, using censorship and force to repress its people."  Obama replied "China has a different political system than we do. China is at a different stage of development than we are. We come from very different cultures and with very different histories. But as I've said before and I repeated to President Hu, we had some core views as Americans about the universality of certain rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly that we think are very important and transcend cultures. I have been very candid with President Hu about these issues."Hu did not initially respond to this question, blaming technical problems. However, upon being asked later, he stated "a lot still needs to be done" with human rights in the country. Hu stated that both China and the United States must appreciate their individual interests. According to {w|CBS News}, the Chinese president was in an "unfamiliar setting"; {w|BBC News Online|BBC News} noted that the meeting was "rare".== Sources ==

[[UK Jobcentre call centre staff on 48-hour strike]]Wikinews spoke to Katrine Williams, one of the representatives of the {w|Public and Commercial Services Union}, and a member of the Civil Service since 1991, to establish the grievances leading to the public-sector industrial action.Balloted in December, over 70% of PCS members voted in favour of strike action; according to Williams, this forced minor concessions from call centre management, but left staff being constantly monitored. With a target of five minutes or less to handle any query related to Job-Seekers' Allowance, staff have been threatened with disciplinary action should they take too long for calls. Williams expressed concern that, with many claimants, it took longer than this to simply establish what the issue was for a member of the public calling in.The number provided for the public to call in relation to benefits is an 0845 number, usually charged at a local call rate when dialled from a landline within the UK; for many claimants, they may only have a mobile phone and be subject to higher charges, or even in a position where a benefit payment has been delayed, and this is their sole contact with the {w|Department of Work and Pensions} when they may be in financial difficulty.Both Williams and David Coventry, who spoke to the UK Press Association, feel let down that their members' expertise is being dismissed; that what is the only option for the unemployed, and a public service, is being managed as-if a commercial enterprise. This, according to Williams, is the prevalent attitude for approximately ten years; managers previously in the private-sector constantly describe the service as a "business", and members of the public requiring assistance as "customers".In describing negotiations with management to avert industrial action, Williams stated: "contact centre managers are [the] worst [within the DWP]", and they, "renege on verbal agreements".The centres hit by strike action are: Bristol, Glasgow, Makerfield near Wigan, Manchester, Newport, Norwich, and Sheffield. Williams stated that a failure on the government's part to resolve the dispute could lead to further action involving the full 30 call centres operated by the DWP. In combination with threats of action by passport office staff in the PCS union, the UK's current coalition government may be faced with significant disruption to essential public services at a time when unemployment figures are climbing.When Wikinews contacted the DWP press office, only a prepared statement was available. Forwarded to Wikinews by Elise Simpson, the department expressed disappointment at industrial action being taken by staff, stating: "only 21% across the centres" were taking action. Appeals for further clarification, and answers to other queries were not returned. Considering the union selectively took action at seven of thirty centres, it would appear the walk-out at those was virtually all staff. Calls to the Jobseekers' 0845 number gave no indication calls may take longer to be connected to someone able to assist with a query or claim.In late December, Brendan Barber of the {w|Trades Union Congress} warned that 2011 may be a year where the UK faces widespread public-sector industrial action. ?81 billion is set to be cut from the UK's expenditure, with the possible loss of over a quarter million public-sector jobs.== Sources == 
[[Romanian father, son convicted of sex trafficking, forced prostitution in UK]]A father and son from Romania have been found guilty of a string of prostitution-related offences in the United Kingdom. For four years, Marius "Mario"  Nejloveanu and father Bogdan trafficked women into and around the UK, forcing their victims into prostitution. Nejloveanu, 23, was also convicted of a series of rapes and headed the business with guidance from his 51-year-old father.Five women were lured from Romania, the youngest in her teens, the oldest 27, with promises of work and romance with Marius. Originally founding a brothel in their hometown of Birmingham, the pair met resistance from local rival pimps and relocated the women to Manchester. There, they worked six or seven days each week, sleeping in brothels and having sex with eight-to-ten men each night against their will. Typical fees from customers were around {w|Pound sterling|?}40 but some may have paid as low as ?10. Around half of each fee went to the Nejloveanus and half to the brothel. Police launched raids, rescuing the women after receiving a tip-off.Bogdan was accused by Rachel Smyth, prosecuting, of giving advice and assistance to Marius; Smyth opened the trial last year telling Manchester {w|Crown Court} "[h]aving heard the evidence you [the jury] may conclude that the son, Marius, learnt this trade from his father and that this was a family business." The woman were "threatened, beaten and degraded" and faced "extreme sexual violence and humiliation," the court heard.Bogdan was convicted of seven offences - three counts of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, three counts of trafficking into the UK for sexual exploitation and controlling prostitution for gain. Marius was found guilty of five counts of trafficking women into the UK for sexual exploitation, one count of conspiracy to traffic a woman into the UK for sexual exploitation, two counts of trafficking women within the UK for sexual exploitation, one count of trafficking a woman out of the UK for sexual exploitation, four counts of rape, five counts of assault, two counts of causing a woman to engage in sexual activity without consent, five counts of controlling prostitution for gain, and one count of witness intimidation to total 27 offences.The duo join two others who admitted lesser roles in the scheme. Costel Maruntelu, 24, was previously jailed for five years and six months for sex trafficking crimes. Juanita "Toni" Huntingdon, 41, helped set up the Birmingham brothel and acted as a receptionist at both sites and entered guilty pleas to five counts of controlling prostitution for gain. Huntingdon and the Nejloveanus will be sentenced on Wednesday.== Sources ==

[[Over 400 attend Scottish singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty's funeral]]Scottish singer-songwriter {w|Gerry Rafferty}'s funeral was held in {w|Paisley} on Friday. Over 400 turned out on the frosty morning as the man behind Baker Street was laid to rest in where he married - {w|St Mirin's Cathedral}, less than a mile from his birthplace.Fans travelled from as far afield as New York to join family, friends and politicians at the service after Rafferty died on January 4 at the age of 63 in {w|Gloucestershire}, England. Born on Underwood Lane in Glenburn, Paisley, Rafferty started performing in local folk clubs in the 1960s before teaming up with {w|Billy Connolly} to form {w|The Humblebums}.Rafferty went on to join with childhood friend {w|Joe Egan|Joe Egan} to form {w|Stealer's Wheel}, achieving chart success in 1973 with {w|Stuck In The Middle With You} - a track which later resurfaced when it appeared on {w|Quentin Tarantino} film {w|Reservoir Dogs}. Rafferty achieved international fame with Baker Street in 1978. He ultimately sold over 10 million records and Baker Street alone earned him an estimated {w|Pound sterling|?}80,000 per year in royalties.Walter MacAusland, a friend and former music promoter and bar owner, described Rafferty on Friday as "incredibly clever, with an incredibly poetic mind." He remembered the man, whom he gave early gigs to in Glasgow, as a retiring man who disliked the attention of fame.Longterm friend {w|John Byrne|John Byrne}, an artist and playwright, delivered a eulogy. "Gerald could be incredibly funny. There are so many occasions when he had me laughing helplessly. But what some people may not appreciate is the lyrics to his songs were incredible. He wrote hundreds and hundreds of songs and he is the greatest songwriter Scotland has ever produced. When I saw him a few weeks ago his body was weak but his spirit as strong as ever. He had a serenity about him that I thought was wonderful." Days before the musician died Byrne received a late-night phone call. "Amongst the things he said, and the one that sticks in my mind and was germane to both of us, and we said it together, was: 'What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his own soul?' I know that he went to meet his maker sober and unafraid, and fiercely curious and with enormous bravery." He concluded by saying "He wasn't a saint, but then which of us are? I loved him dearly." Byrne designed album sleeves for Rafferty's music. Egan also spoke: "We hadn't spoken for a couple of years, but that didn¡¯t really matter because we were so close. After all, we'd lived out of each other¡¯s pockets for years. But I'm sad. Really, really sad."Six of his family performed one of his songs unaccompanied at the service - his deceased brother Joe's children Neal, Brian, Eileen, Claire and Mark, and his daughter Martha. They sang Whatever's Written In Your Heart from his album {w|City to City}. "We all used to sing this song in the house as a kid," Martha said. "We loved singing his songs, and this one just seemed perfect for today."Father John Tormey led the {w|Requiem Mass}, saying Rafferty "was very much aware of the spiritual element and you will find that in his songs." Tormey acknowledged the man's tendency to shun fame and attention, saying he "shunned the trappings of fame and celebrity to be true to himself."Musicians attending included {w|The Proclaimers}, {w|Robert Noakes} and {w|Graham Lyle}. Proclaimer {w|Craig Reid} said "Music was Gerry's passion. He said music is something that you have to pass on to other people. You don't own it and it goes through you. His music reflected that." The two worked together on the song {w|Letter From America}, which Rafferty produced. Craig's twin brother {w|Charlie Reid|Charlie} recalled "Gerry was great for his refusal to sell out and his determination to do his own thing. This man was respected for what he did."Rafferty spent his entire life dealing with alcohol use. Nor was this his only health problem: "There have  been periods in my life where  I have experienced depression," he said in a recent interview. "It has been through some of my darkest moments that I have written some of my best songs. For me, singing and writing is very therapeutic.  It's much more effective than taking Prozac!"Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond attended, as did {w|Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament} {w|Hugh Henry}, {w|Wendy Alexander}, {w|Pauline McNeill} and {w|Robin Harper}. Billy Connolly was unable to attend due to tour commitments in Australia. {w|Raphael Ravenscroft}, the saxophonist who famously played the main riff in Baker Street, recorded a track in {w|Exeter} to mark the occasion.After the funeral members of the public gave Rafferty his last applause as his cortege departed the cathedral, which is also a mile from Rafferty's former school, {w|St Mirin's Academy}. His body was taken for a private cremation.== Sources ==

[[Final US manufacturer ceases production of lethal injection drug; executions delayed]]The sole United States manufacturer of a key component of lethal injections announced Friday that it will cease production of the drug, contributing to shortages and delaying executions.In a statement, the company, {w|Hospira}, said that they have never condoned the use of their drug, marketed as 'Pentothal', in executions, and that they could not "prevent the drug from being diverted to departments of corrections for use in capital punishment procedures".The move means that the United States is without a viable supplier for sodium thiopental. Although many European countries manufacture the drug, which is primarily used in Europe as an {w|anaesthetic|an?sthetic}, no manufacturer has been found that is willing to supply it for use in conjunction with the death penalty, the abolition of which has been lobbied by the EU since 2008.The shortage means that executions in California and Oklahoma have been delayed, with Texas' last remaining stocks of the drug due to expire in March, weeks before two scheduled executions. These delays are likely to be prolonged as the legal process of drawing up new drugs to be used for injections is lengthy. Pentobarbital, an alternative which used at the {w|Dignitas|Dignitas} clinic in Switzerland, is used for lethal injections in Oregon, and has started to be used by Oklahoma.Hospira's decision caused mixed reactions throughout the medical community, with the {w|American Society of Anesthesiologists} stating Monday that sodium thiopental is an "important and medically necessary anesthetic agent" that is a "first-line anesthetic in many cases", citing geriatric and cardiovascular conditions, among others. It said that, although they disagree with the death penalty, "we also do not condone using the issue as the basis to place undue burdens on the distribution of this critical drug to the United States. It is an unfortunate irony that many more lives will be lost or put in jeopardy as a result of not having the drug available for its legitimate medical use."== Sources ==

The case, which is now adjourned for three weeks, could result in a 20 year prison sentence. The three Indonesians will reappear in court on 15 Febuary via video link. Their attourney, David McKenzie, stated that the men are "unhappy" and that the wreck was "a total tragedy and they're very upset."A day earlier, an Australian Customs internal report cleared both the Customs authorities and the Navy of any blame, stating that all personnel acted appropriately and exercised good judgment. Eight recommendations have been made to prevent a similar incident, including the establishment of a land-based radar system to monitor northern maritime approaches to the island. The recommendations will be implemented by June 30, 2011.== Sources ==

[[Ivory Coast trade embargo backed by US]]The United States has stated Monday that it will support a month-long ban on cocoa exports from the Ivory Coast, which was called for by its internationally recognised president, Alassane Ouattara. The move comes as Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent president of C?te d'Ivoire, refused to concede the presidency after November's election.Ouattara hopes that the embargo will result in Gbagbo being forced to resign, unable to pay civil servants, including the security forces, due to lost revenue. "We do support President Ouattara's call for a month-long ban on cocoa exports, our embassy is in touch with relevant players on this", said US State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.US agricultural firm {w|Cargill}, which buys around 15% of Ivorian cocoa, have said they are "temporarily suspending" those purchases.  "We are working with others in the industry and with the authorities to clarify and resolve the situation as quickly as possible", Cargill stated.Gbagbo's finance minister, Desire Dalo, denied that the embargo has had any effect on the country's cocoa production.  {w|Mars, Inc.|Mars}, one of the world's largest confectionery manufacturers, said in a statement that "as a major end-user of Ivorian cocoa we will work with our suppliers in the face of this ban", and that "in the short term this will not impact our ability to manufacture the chocolate products".== Sources ==

[[BBC World Service to drop five languages]]According to the BBC News website, five languages are to be cut from the BBC World Service's coverage. {w|Albanian language|Albanian}, {w|Macedonian language|Macedonian}, and {w|Serbian language|Serbian} are no longer going to be used on the global radio station, and {w|Portuguese language|Portuguese} will no longer be used in African regional programmes, nor English in the Caribbean. Seven undisclosed languages are also going to be scaled back. The cuts mean that approximately 650 jobs will be lost in order to save around ?46m. The cuts were officially announced at a staff briefing on Thursday.The BBC's director of global news, Peter Horrocks, said that the cuts were "not a reflection on the performance of individual services or programmes", and were cut due to a "need to make savings", after the Government's grant-in-aid funding was cut. The BBC took over funding the World Service in October 2010, previously funded by the Foreign Office. The move comes just days after announcements that the funding for the BBC website is to be slashed by ?34m as part of 25% cuts across the spectrum of services offered by the taxpayer-funded broadcaster.The National Union of Journalists protested the "drastic cuts" outside the World Service headquarters today, stating that the loss of the language editions "severely damage the national interest of the UK".== Sources == 
[[Boy arrested for murder after seventeen-year-old run over by bus]]A fifteen-year-old boy has been arrested in {w|Walthamstow}, London, England after Ezekiel Amosu, 17, was run over by a bus Monday night. {w|Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police} detectives said that Amosu may have been "involved in an altercation with a group of teenagers immediately beforehand".Amosu was walking with four friends when they were approached by a group of youths, who asked for Amosu's mobile phone.

[[Toyota recalls 1.7m cars after new concerns]]Car manufacturer Toyota is to recall almost 1.7 million cars in two simultaneous recalls, that include the {w|Toyota Avensis} and {w|Lexus IS 250}, after concerns over fuel systems, which, if combined, amount to the biggest Toyota recall for six years.Japan's transport ministry stated it was possible for slight cracks to appear in fuel pipes in Avensis models, which may widen if the cars continue to be used. In the United Kingdom, Toyota GB are offering free repairs, which are expected to take around four and a half hours each. The Lexus IS 250 is involved in a separate recall, with around 280 thousand models outside of Japan being recalled over a faulty fuel pressure sensor, which can possibly come loose, causing a fuel leak.The Managing Director of Toyota GB stated "We are committed to putting the customer first and have a total focus on the quality of all our products. We will liaise with our customers to carry out the repair procedures as efficiently as possible, with minimal disruption".Toyota has recalled over 16 million cars globally since late 2009.==Sources== 
[[Wikinews interviews Jim Hedges, U.S. Prohibition Party presidential candidate]]U.S. {w|Prohibition Party} presidential candidate Jim Hedges of {w|Thompson Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania|Thompson Township}, Pennsylvania took some time to answer a few questions about the Prohibition Party and his 2012 presidential campaign. The Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the United States, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late 19th century. The party heavily supported the {w|Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution}, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the US period known as {w|Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition}. It was repealed in 1933.  The party has declined since this period, but has continued to nominate candidates for the presidential election.In 2003, the party split into two factions. Preacher {w|Gene Amondson} and perennial candidate {w|Earl Dodge} were nominated for the presidency by their respective factions. After Dodge's death in 2007, the party reunified and named Amondson as its sole presidential nominee for 2008. During the election, Amondson was interviewed by Wikinews.  He died in 2009, leaving an opening in the party for 2012.Jim Hedges is a longtime {w|Prohibition} activist, who holds the distinction of the first individual of the 21st century to be elected to a political office under the Prohibition Party banner. In 2001, he was elected as the Thompson Township {w|Tax assessment|tax assessor}, and was re-elected to the post in 2005.  He served until his term expired in 2010. Hedges declared his intent to run for the Prohibition Party presidential nomination on February 18, 2010.  This marks his first run for the presidency.Why?  Well, I liked, and still like, the Prohibition platform better than I do the platform of any other political group.  Partly, this is because of the anti-alcohol plank, but more generally because it seems more principled and more reasonable.The split was caused by dissatisfaction with Dodge¡¯s management.  Dodge was a somewhat paranoid person who trusted no one to help him.  For  example, he made one of his daughters "treasurer" of the Prohibition National Committee, but he did not allow her access to the bank account.  He was the only "signer" listed on the check card.   Another example:  He used money from a bequest to purchase a small office condominium, then without telling even his vice-chairman, he mortgaged the condo, cashed it out, and after a time lost it; the vice-chairman discovered all this only after Dodge died.   Dodge could sell the office condo undetected, because he held it in the name of a shell corporation controlled by himself and the said daughter.Amondson was a congenial person, warm and approachable.  He was recommended to us by one of our supporters.  He had an act, a re-creation of Rev. {w|Billy Sunday}¡¯s sermon on booze, which he performed at conservative churches and other sympathetic venues.  We hoped that his name recognition and the audience appeal of his act would enhance the Party¡¯s appeal.As it turned out, he had a handicap, analogous to dyslexia, which prevented him from stringing words together into fluent sentences.  His act was great.  His public speaking and his writing were, um, unremarkable.We miss his ability to attract attention to us.The rest of that is campaign hyperbole. Many times in the past, the Prohibition Party has recruited presidential candidates from outside its own ranks.  The same may happen again this year.   If not, I see myself as being the most  broadly educated and widely experienced person within the core group of the Party.  I have a {w|Bachelor of Arts|BA} in musical performance and served 20 years in one of our nation¡¯s most elite military units, The {w|United States Marine Band}.  I have a family-farm background, plus 20 years of life in the {w|Washington Metropolitan Area|Washington, DC metropolitan area}.  I understand both rural and urban communities.I have an {w|Master of Arts|MA} in Geography,  have published research in refereed journals both here and abroad, and for 11 years edited a journal.  I have done volunteer work with and served as an officer of community organizations ranging from The {w|Salvation Army} to friends of the library to recycling programs to historical and literary clubs.I have done newspaper reporting, primarily on local government.A vote of the  credentialed delegates will determine who is the candidate.For small parties, the states where they run has very little to do with where they have the most support and very much to do with which states have the easiest regulations.The platform most likely will address a lot of other things, but, let¡¯s face it:  The Prohibition Party today is an exercise in living history.  We¡¯re like the weekend warriors who put on costumes and {w|American Civil War reenactment|re-enact the Civil War}.  The South is not going to rise again.  Neither is national prohibition going to come back.  But in both cases, we think there are important historical lessons which ought not be forgotten.  And so, we soldier on against all odds.Unless we stay on the message, our living history lesson will be lost.  I¡¯ve been asking around.  I know who I¡¯d like to have, but it¡¯s still under discussion.Health should enter into it.  We don¡¯t need another {w|Ronald Reagan|Reagan}!If I should receive the nomination, the website will have to be improved, and there will have to be press releases and some personal visits to states where we get on the ballot.  I¡¯ll have to obtain advice on making more effective use of the internet. Every day is different, but that¡¯s the basic schedule.Obama was dealt a miserable hand, but even so, I¡¯m becoming disappointed.  We still have Bush¡®s {w|deficit spending}.  We still have {w|Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush¡¯s wars}.  We still have Bush¡¯s failure to secure {w|Mexico ¨C United States border|the border with Mexico}.  We still have Bush¡¯s {w|outsourcing|exporting American jobs overseas}.  What is there to like?Obama did end Bush¡¯s "{w|Mexico City Policy|global gag rule}," which attempted to prevent family planning agencies all over the world from even discussing abortion.  And he did make a stab at improving medical care.The Tea Party folks are on the right track in trying to get the federal budget deficit under control.  I fear, though, that they lack the patience and flexibility to do the job gracefully.   And, they¡¯re too easily distracted by unrelated issues.We need to stop being the world¡¯s bully and, instead, lead by example:  ratify {w|Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto}, ratify {w|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW}, rein in the international corporations.  Look at the things he has done since leaving the White House, then look at the things other presidents have done after their terms ended.  Carter has continued to serve the American people, and the world, while the others have hie¡¯d themselves to their clubs and estates, to their lecture circuits and their corporate boards.  Yes, I would like to be a person such as Jimmy Carter.

[[Massive anti-government protests in Egypt continue into second day, several killed]]Reports say such massive protests have never been seen in the country before; they come two weeks after Tunisian president {w|Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali} was overthrown by a popular revolt. Egyptian protestors, apparently inspired by the fall of Ben Ali, are demanding that Mubarak resign, complaining about unemployment, poverty, repression, and other issues.Over five hundred protestors were arrested during the skirmishes. Local media reports that at least fifty people have been wounded by the violence. According to media, however, there were somewhat fewer protestors on the second day of the rallies than the first, dubbed the "Day of Wrath" by anti-government supporters.Egypt's stock market reacted negatively to the clashes, going down by six percent on Wednesday, and the Egyptian pound reached a six-year low against the US dollar.== Sources ==

[[Australia announces levy bill to offset cost of Queensland floods]]The {w|Prime Minister} of Australia, Julia Gillard, has today announced a new bill into Parliament to assist in the {w|2010¨C2011 Queensland floods|Queensland floods} recovery. The proposed levy will be a once-off tax, given only to those with an annual income of above {w|AUD|A$}50,000. Exemptions to the flood relief fund will be given to those who are income earners of less than $50,000 a year or those who were affected by the flood crisis. Anyone earning between the ranges of $50,000 to $100,000 will contribute 0.5 percent of their income whilst anyone earning over $100,000 annually will pay 1 percent.During her announcement, Gillard stated: "Under this levy, someone who has an income of $60,000 will pay just under $1 extra per week. A person earning $100,000 per year will pay just under an extra $5 per week."The levy is set to contribute to the relief effort to assist in the five-billion-dollar reconstruction of Queensland infrastructure. The Government will obtain three billion dollars through the scratching of certain schemes and the postponement of others. The levy will then contribute the other two billion.The bill has not come without criticism. The leader of the opposing {w|Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party}, Tony Abbott, has claimed that there is "fat" in the budget. He said there should be no requirement for Australians to contribute towards a levy, but rather the government should cut back on its own spending.Gillard responded to Abbott's claims by saying that the Liberal's proposed paid maternity leave scheme would have required Australian people to pay a levy, and that it is unjustifiable that they then wouldn¡¯t allow for the rebuilding of Queensland.Independent {w|Bob Katter} has said that until a designated fund for natural disaster relief is established by the Government, he will not approve of any relief levies introduced into parliament. {w|Tony Windsor}, a fellow independent, agreed. With Labor currently in a minority government, the passing of the bill is in jeopardy without the support of the independents.There is currently no certainty that the bill will be introduced yet. It must first be approved in the Lower House and then in the Senate.== Sources ==

[[US government to replace color-coded terror alert system]]United States {w|Secretary of Homeland Security} {w|Janet Napolitano} said Thursday that the country's government would end its color-coded threat assessment system, called the {w|Homeland Security Advisory System}. The announcement came one day after rumors about such a move surfaced.Napolitano, who made the announcement at {w|George Washington University}, said a new advisory system would be implemented in April. "When we have information about a specific, credible threat, we will issue a formal alert providing as much information as we can," she said. "The alerts will be specific to the threat. They may recommend certain actions or suggest looking for specific suspicious behavior. And they will have a specified end date."The color-based system has been heavily criticized since its introduction after the 9/11 attacks. Napolitano said it often presented "little practical information" to the public. For most of its existence, the Homeland Security Advisory System has stayed at the yellow and orange levels. The new {w|National Terrorism Advisory System} will have only two threat levels: "imminent" and "elevated."The current system will begin to be deprecated this week, but it has been under the scrutiny of the US {w|Department of Homeland Security} since 2009.== Sources == 
[[Taliban bombing in Kabul supermarket leaves eight dead]]At least eight people have died after a suicide attack at a supermarket in {w|Kabul}, Afghanistan.

The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack, with Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid stating: "We claim responsibility for the attack, and it was carried out at a time when foreigners were shopping, including the head of a security company".The last major attack on civilians occurred last February, when fourteen were killed in two separate bombings, and there have been multiple attacks against security forces in the meantime.== Sources == 
[[Ipswich, England serial murders to be adapted into 'musical']]The {w|Ipswich serial murders}, in which five female prostitutes were killed in {w|Ipswich}, {w|Suffolk}, England, are to be turned into a show entitled London Road. The "documentary musical" is expected to debut in the {w|Royal National Theatre} in London this April.The concept has been criticised. When {w|ITN} conducted some {w|vox populi} interviews, members of the public reacted negatively: "[A]lmost makes it seem a bit light-hearted, doesn't it? It takes the impact out of it," one woman said. One man said that it would "bring back memories to [the families of the victims] and that's not right." Another woman remarked: "It's not a musical, you know, it's a tragedy for the families it happened to." {QuoteLeft|It's not a musical, you know, it's a tragedy for the families it happened to.|source=Female member of the public}The Reverend Andrew Dotchin, who knew victim Tania Nicol, advised: "It's holy ground. Take your shoes off. Walk carefully. Remember you're dealing not so much with an event in the news but with something that in a real sense that is still alive, still affecting lives. It has a great potential to bring healing but if you're not careful, it can also bring harm."In their defence, a National Theatre spokeswoman made a statement, saying "London Road has been created from edited interviews recorded with people from Ipswich and is a serious look at the effect on the community of this tragic event, rather than at the murders or victims themselves; and at how the community was able to pull together to create something positive out of the tragedy. {HYS question left|Is this show a bad idea or a good one?} We're not going to call it a musical in future because we recognise it gives a misleading impression; the music will do something very different by reflecting the voices of the interviewees. We realise how sensitive a subject this is and hope that, when people come to see it, they will see that the piece doesn't seek to exploit or sensationalise but to shed light on a side of the story that hasn't previously been told."The name London Road is a reference to the name of the street where {w|Steve Wright|Steve Wright} lived. Wright was was jailed in February 2008 for the murders of Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams, Anneli Alderton, Annette Nicholls and Paula Clennell - all of whom were female prostitutes that lived in the Ipswich region.

[[Australian House of Representatives]]We seem to have become sidetracked into a discussion of the punishment component of a sentence, presumably triggered by my putdown of the standard argument for executions. Some thoughts: Without a punishment part, there ceases to be a deterrent. Fines become unworkable since the necessary value of one would hopelessly bankrupt a convict as you move up the scale of seriousness - which isn't going to produce a more well-rounded person. Some element of punishment is often an unpleasant necessity and we should not buck away from it just because we'd rather avoid it. In many cases involving serious or violent crime, punishment ceases to be an issue since the necessary rehabilitation time is far in excess anyway.However, the present situation is such that all we really have from prison is punishment and protection of the public. Punishment should generally be the least of all the considerations in a sentence, but it is currently the main. Rehabilitation is all but nonexistent in most of the world. To give examples I am familiar with, look at the cut of funding to HMP Grendon or, going further back, the closure of Special Unit at HMP Barlinnie, a smaller-scale scheme with similar aims in Scotland. Anybody with a non-life sentence is in jail purely for punishment with very few exceptions, and that is unjustifiable.The release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi should have no bearing on your views on reform since - making the controversial assumption the conviction itself was correct or at least irrelevant - the cited reason was compassion for a dying man. Anybody who wishes to discuss the validity of such should not be tackling the decision itself, but rather the legislation as it stands: predictions of death are not an exact science - how long is Hawking overdue? Compassion is utterly vital, but the debate that should have and has never happened is how to go forward on that with such margins of uncertainty.As a side note, a difficult problem is measuring reform, though it is not insurmountable and, indeed, it is supposedly already done for those by parole boards reviewing indefinite sentences once the minimum term has passed. As in to how it works currently I have no idea; just how the conditions of decades as a prisoner in Category A or B prison are supposed to reform anyone is beyond me.Regarding assisted suicide, I'd rather the scheme for those with illness or infirmity etc be entirely separate from any scheme for longterm prisoners.One case I'd point at, whilst we are on the subject, is an Amerikan who killed another inmate because he wanted to die and the only method available was the death penalty. I would class that as a suicide as much as an execution.
[[Egypt anti-government protests continue, Internet shut down]]Anti-government protestors in Egypt rallying against the rule of president Hosni Mubarak took to the streets for a fourth straight day, demanding the long-time leader step down and complaining of poverty, corruption, and oppression. The demonstrations were supposedly inspired by a popular uprising that saw Tunisian president {w|Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali} ousted from office. A national curfew is in effect, but is being ignored by many. Tens of thousands of people spilled out into streets after Friday prayers today, chanting slogans like "Down, down with Mubarak" and "The people want the regime to fall". At least eighteen people died in the violence between riot police and protestors, with hundreds more wounded. Up to a thousand people have been arrested.Police responded to protestors by deploying rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. In addition, Mubarak ordered the army out onto the streets to help quell the conflict. He was earlier supposed to make a statement, but hasn't yet done so.In Cairo, demonstrators targeted the heavily-guarded state broadcasting building, as well as the building of the ruling {w|National Democratic Party|National Democratic Party}, which was set on fire, according to a BBC reporter. In {w|Sinai}, armed men took several policemen hostage after seizing a road leading into a nearby town. Former International Atomic Energy Agency head Mohamed ElBaradei, a prominent opposition figure, was taken into custody by authorities and now under house arrest, {w|The Telegraph} reports.Meanwhile, according to media reports and statistics, Egypt has shut down practically all Internet traffic both out of and into the nation, as well as disrupting cellphone usage. A graph by Arbor Networks available on the {w|New York Times} website shows an almost vertical drop in overall Egypt internet traffic, starting shortly before four o'clock in the afternoon with over 2.5 million megabits per second down to almost zero in the space of an hour."Almost nobody in Egypt has Internet connectivity, and there are no workarounds. I¡¯ve never seen it happen at this scale," said the chief technology officer for Renesys, a company that tracks Internet traffic. "In a fundamental sense, it¡¯s as if you rewrote the map and they are no longer a country. I never thought it would happen to a country the size and scale of Egypt."Andrew Noyes, spokesman for Facebook, noted that the social website had seen almost all of its Egypt traffic disappear and there is only a "minimal" amount left. In a statement, Noyes said: "Although the turmoil in Egypt is a matter for the Egyptian people and their government to resolve, limiting Internet access for millions of people is a matter of concern for the global community."== Sources ==

[[Russian police say Moscow airport bomber identified]]Police in Russia say they have identified the man behind the bombing of Moscow's {w|Domodedovo International Airport} on Monday, although they will not yet name him. Police said the man who killed 35 was a twenty-year-old suicide bomber from the {w|North Caucasus} region.An {w|Investigative Committee of Russia|Investigative Committee} statement delivered by spokesman Vladimir Markin said "We have established the identity of the terrorist suicide bomber who set off the explosive. He turned out to be a 20-year-old native from one of the North Caucasus republics," and "Despite the investigation having established the name of the terrorist, we will not name him today," because it may hamper ongoing efforts to detain people suspected of collaborating. Markin added "I  would especially like to note that it was by no means an accident that the act of terror was committed in the international arrivals hall... According to investigators, the act of terror was first and foremost aimed against foreign citizens." Eight of those killed were foreigners and several flights had just landed from European origins.President Dmitry Medvedev sacked several transportations officials in the wake of the bombing. The nation's transport infrastructure will deal with extra visitors when the country hosts the {w|2014 Winter Olympics} and {w|2018 World Cup}. Medvedev has targeted both security officials and airport management in the wake of the bombing.Few official details have been released by the investigation and unofficial reports in the press have been contradictory; one report suggested a suicide bomber wearing a {w|plastic explosive}-based shrapnel bomb belt. Another said it could have been detonated remotely, while a third suggested a timer. Russian newspapers initially suggested a bag had exploded on the floor, while local TV has shown CCTV footage of the explosion. Unconfirmed reports also claim the {w|Federal Security Service} was searching for three people ahead of the attack and that the bomber was Vitaly Razdobudko of {w|Stavropol}.Although nobody has claimed responsibility or been arrested for the airport attack, Markin told reporters several people have been brought in on suspicion of planning an attack on December 31, while others are being sought. He linked them to an explosion on the 31st in a Moscow hotel, in which a bomber died after the device he was building went off prematurely.Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the attack is not thought to be linked to Chechnyan insurgency.

Note that I'll try to avoid reviewing articles until I think I've got enough experience, though I'll probably accept edits like tyop fixes.  Kayau 10:02, 4 April 2011The request has been open for two days and has received sufficient input, so I am closing it as successful. Out of thirteen !votes, 11 are in support of granting BG reviewer. While valid concerns have been raised, I see consensus to grant BG the reviewer status. Pmlineditor 10:43, 2 April 2011What the hell. People have already told me that going this early will probably fail for some obscure reason or another, but here I am, requesting the reviewer flag. I've been lurking around Wikinews for a month or so now, but have only been actively contributing for the past week or so. I've had three articles approved in that time and as I write this have a fourth awaiting review, including my first stab at some OR. Reviewing is something that appeals to me and, particularly considering there's generally a backlog, should be something of assistance to the community. I've been "going through the motions" on various articles for a few days and am clued up on what's what. Finally, for context, I'm also an active user at simple.wikipedia and have been active in the past at en.wikipedia. I've a good knowledge of both sides of the MediaWiki software and Flagged Revisions in particular, so know what I am doing. Whilst my Wikinews experience is probably below the threshold for many, I also run a free online e-magazine which is where my "news"/journalism experience lies. Hope that all makes sense. Comments welcome... I realise it's set up in a certain way but please don't vote? Comments are soooooo much more useful! :) Thanks! Goblin 02:57, 31 March 2011User withdrew. Diego Grez return fire 19:24, 27 March 2011I 'gave up' the right last night thinking I was leaving, but I made a mistake. Please and thanks. --Nascar1996 18:41, 27 March 2011Asking to become reviewer so more articles which have been prepared by others - all well sourced and no problem, but just never received the time or focus. Another eye could help with this. Also, many times the regular news outlets are giving the news with a POV, while the facts are clearly shown in sources, such as the pullout of US aid or failure to detain the radiation in Japan, that could be seen for a day before officially reaching the mainstream news outlets. I believe I can be more impartial and objective on these issues, since I am a private citizen, not working for any government. I've been here on wikinews for at least 4 years, and on wikpedia, wikitext - status moderator, wiktionary, wikiCommons - contributor of various images and illustrations - mostly in the field of science, and other wiki projects. I have written about various people and issues, where all the information I had was from web research, then discovered that these people or issues were controversial. Followed up in depth to learn what the claims of both sides are. Then sided with what I believed is the truth. Proved it, and most of the times the claims where accepted, even against fierce opposition. Please see for example w:Adil Najam which was deleted 3 times before my addition. Especially telling are w:Talk:Adil Najam) and the article's history. In this particular case, I learned that the critics where correct in the details, but incorrect in the whole: He is influential and well known, although he is not the "Nobel prise laureate" as depicted in the earlier articles. In other cases I learned that I was wrong in my suppositions, and clearly appreciated that in writing. By the way, I had stumbled on Adil Najam and his environmental theories, without knowing that there were any politics involvedI thank anyone who responds regardless of the outcome, and hope to serve the wikinews writer and reader community to the best! Pashute 11:54, 24 March 2011It has been extended for more than two days, and nothing has changed. There's no consensus, and it is pointless to keep the request for more time. Diego Grez return fire 21:48, 24 March 2011Hi everyone! Despite quite a lengthy absence from Wikinews due to educational commitments, I have now found myself with a bit more time and thus feel that I could handle the job of reviewer on Wikinews. I now have six articles and just a tad over 500 edits and have a sound knowledge of the MoS and other publishing guidelines. Seeing recent discussions about reviewing recently, I feel that I should re-apply for the bit. Thanks, ~YTT T | C  10:35, 20 March 2011Hi, I'm Mono. I've been working here for a couple months now; so far I've written 10 articles and gotten the hang of the processes here. I'm active in #wikinews and have seen the trouble the project has had getting articles published in a timely fashion, so I am applying for reviewer rights. I've worked with Flagged Revisions before and I have read the documentation. I will admit that my edit count is not large, but this is mainly since I have concentrated on writing content. Recently, I've been looking at other articles, offering suggestions, and improving them. Thanks, theMONO 00:12, 18 March 2011Appears very unlikely to pass due to lack of experience of candidate and oppose !votes, closed quickly basically per this And yes I do know it is not a WN policy...

I'd like to think I'm a reasonably trustworthy person and although my edit count is low, that's mostly because I tend to write articles straight through in one pass rather than stitch them together like a quilt as some editors seem to do. I'd say the article I'm most proud of is UK Parliament to vote on tuition fee rise on Thursday, a lengthy, synoptic article on the politics of the UK university tuition fees debate. I understand the publishing process, have read the policies and the MOS. Thanks. ¡ªTom Morris 08:44, 12 March 2011No opposes in 48 hours, flag granted. Pmlineditor 10:56, 13 March 2011Some time ago, as you will probably remember, I asked for my rights as a reviewer to be removed unilaterally due to my publication of a serious copyright violation.  A fair while has passed since that occurred, and although still a little shaky, I think since you're crying out for reviewers, that I must put my oar back in and ask for a decision from the community on a re-grant of my rights to review.  I've had enough of being a spectator.  I know what I did wrong, I've learned from it, I won't do it again. Simples :) BarkingFish 13:02, 11 March 2011Reviewer permission granted per unanimous support at the end of 48 hours.

I had originally planned to hold off on a request for reviewership, but in the last couple weeks I've seen one too many good articles go down the drain simply because there was not a reviewer available to review the article in time.  Additionally, after seeing the nomination of User:Mattisse, I believe I am qualified to be a reviewer.  I've read WN:REVIEW, WN:CONTENT, and large parts of WN:MOS.  I've also followed the contributions of User:Pi zero, User:Brian McNeil, and User:Blood Red Sandman to better understand how WN works, since I first came here from WP.

Diego Grez return fire 21:53, 30 January 2011It has been just over a month since my last request for reviewer. Over the period of time between, I have: received accreditation, written more articles, studied the style guide and general Wikinews policies to ensure a high standard of writing, become more active by copyediting other articles and I have participated in some informal reviews. I have also been carrying out general maintenance work on the wiki such as updating leads, placing tags on articles and keeping an eye out for vandalism, spam and copyvios.

[[Egyptian president will not seek re-election in September after protests]]Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has announced that he will not seek re-election in September 2011, after an uprising against him across the country. Mubarak stated on state television, "I will say with all honesty and without looking at this particular situation that I was not intent on standing for the next elections, because I have spent enough time in serving Egypt." Mubarak added, "I am now careful to conclude my work for Egypt by presenting Egypt to the next government in a constitutional way which will protect Egypt."Soon after his announcement, protesters filled the street, demanding that he resign immediately. United States president Barack Obama spoke with Mubarak after the announcement to discuss the situation in Egypt. Obama said at the White House, "[Mubarak] recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and that change must take place. [...] My belief that an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now."The country has released statements since Sunday calling for a "orderly transition", with interim leadership to prepare for the September election. United States Senator {w|John F. Kerry} called upon Hosni to work to create "an interim, caretaker government as soon as possible to oversee an orderly transition in the coming months." In Egypt, the address sparked rioting after, as citizens were angered that the president refused to resign at once. The popular uprising in Egypt began on January 25, 2011, in the wake of the Tunisian {w|2010¨C2011 Tunisian uprising|uprising} weeks before.== Sources == 
[[Massive snowstorm blasts most of United States]]A massive winter storm has hit most of the United States with large amounts of blowing snow, rain, severe thunderstorms, and high winds, causing blizzard conditions in many areas, and hitting places like Chicago, Illinois with snow at the rate of 3¨C4 inches per hour. The massive storm stretches from New Mexico to Maine. Chicago received 19.5 inches of snow by Wednesday morning, and winds reached speeds of 50 mph in the night. Other places such as Buffalo, New York could get up to eight inches of snow by Thursday. The storm brought badly needed rain to areas in the United States south, but also hit the Florida panhandle with a tornado watch. Chicago and nearby areas also experienced {w|thundersnow} at times. Thundersnow is a type of thunderstorm with snow falling instead of rain.Many power failures occurred in hard-hit areas, due to icing, which coated power lines with thick ice. Up to 18,000 customers in Indiana lost power, and almost 80,000 {w|ComEd} customers in the Chicago area were without power. Thousands in Oklahoma also lost power. "If you don't have to travel, don't do it. If you can stay home, do it. You might get in. You won't get back," Kansas governor {w|Sam Brownback} advised. In Illinois, Governor {w|Pat Quinn|Pat Quinn} activated over 500 National Guard troops, and Missouri activated 850 Guard troops. Over 20% of flights in the United States were grounded due to bad weather, and Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport had to close Tuesday morning due to an ice storm.The snowstorm may affect 100 million Americans, roughly a third of that country's population. "It's unusual for a storm to affect such a broad swath of the country and so many big cities," said {w|:The Weather Channel} meteorologist Mark Ressler. The snowfall rate in some places was "incredibly heavy," he added.In Chicago, where snow was heaviest, 2,200 flights were cancelled at {w|Chicago O'Hare International Airport}. {w|Chicago Midway Airport}, the city's smaller airport, suspended flight operations. Classes within the Chicago Public School system were cancelled for Wednesday, the first time since 1999.

[[London and Toronto stock exchanges propose merger]]Only weeks before the Canadian government in Ottawa is expected to table a budget which may trigger a national election, the announcement of a proposed 3.2 billion {w|Canadian dollar|CAD} merger between the {w|TMX Group|Toronto} and {w|London Stock Exchange Group|London} stock exchanges to produce the largest single exchange.Even as news was beginning to leak about the mega-merger, {w|Deutsche B?rse|Deutsche B?rse AG} and {w|NYSE Euronext} announced deep negotiations under way regarding a merger between the third and second, respectively, largest exchange groups by total revenues. The proposed TMX-LSE group merger would produce the largest market in terms of listings - approximately 6,700 companies are traded between the two groups - but total annual receipts would likely not make it the largest in dollars.Technically the merger is a takeover of Toronto-based TMX by the LSE Group, with LSE shareholders owning 55% of the new company. TMX head Thomas Kloet would become CEO of the new firm, while LSE's executive would take chairmanship of a new board consisting of 8 members from LSE and 7 from TMX.Canadian Industry Minister {w|Tony Clement} has said the government will review the merger, which raises the spectre of a government rejection of a deal which would see yet another large Canadian corporation under foreign ownership. The ruling conservatives have been dogged by the issue, and have blocked two other foreign ownership bids during the current government's terms - last year's {w|Potash Corp.} takeover bid from {w|BHP Billiton} and the earlier {w|Alliant Techsystems Inc.} bid for {w|MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.|MacDonald} space technologies branch, the only two such blocks ever made by a Canadian government.Canadian opposition parties challenged the Prime Minister over the proposal, with {w|New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party} leader {w|Jack Layton} questioning the benefits of the deal. "Of course, Canadian companies need access to foreign capital, but not at the expense of our own capital markets," he said. Canadian Prime Minister {w|Stephen Harper} refused to comment on the proposal, having been criticised for involving his office in the Potash bid.Both the Quebec and Ontario regulatory commissions are also involved in reviewing the deal, which is set for October 2011, as their provincial exchanges are in Montreal and Toronto respectively.== Sources ==

[[South Sudan minister Milla shot, killed]]South Sudan's Cooperatives and Rural Development Minister, Jimmy Lemi Milla, was shot and killed yesterday at his office in Juba, South Sudan.  Officials said they believed the shooting was not politically motivated.According to witnesses, after the minister and his bodyguard had entered the ministry building, the shooter broke into the minister's car and took from it the bodyguard's pistol, entered the building, and shot and killed first the minister, then the bodyguard.  He was subdued and taken into custody.  According to officials, the shooter, who may have been the minister's brother-in-law, had been employed by Milla and wanted to be paid.Civil servant Richard Lukodu said, "This is such a shock to the people here, coming so soon after our peaceful referendum... This is the result of one angry man ¡ª and people should not think that this is reflective of all of south Sudan."South Sudan held a referendum last month on secession from Sudan.  Following decades of civil war officially ending in 2005, violence in the south has been a continuing problem, but lessened leading up to the referendum.  The result of the referendum was overwhelmingly for secession, and the President of Sudan has stated acceptance of that result.== Sources ==

[[Air Canada back in the black in 2010]]In the final quarter of 2010, airline {w|Air Canada} earnings rose to 134 million {w|Canadian dollar|CAD}, 42 cents per share, capping a sharp return to profitability in 2010.The year resulted in the company's highest-ever earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, and rent of $1.39 billion, 707 million more than the previous year. Operating income for fourth quarter was reported as $85 million, which compared very favourably with an $83 million loss in 2009.Only 21 months ago Air Canada was threatened with bankruptcy and using its financial weakness in negotiations with its employees, achieving status quo contracts. With labour contracts scheduled to end this month and next, the strong position of the airlines is expected to stiffen union resolve to share in the increased net revenues.Those revenues were helped by increasing numbers of passengers and reducing costs, as well as foreign exchange gains. International travel, especially to the Pacific region, led the rises. US travellers through the main Toronto hub more than doubled, indicating the increase in foreign air traffic to and through Canadian airports.== Sources ==

Mubarak stepped down after eighteen days of mass protests across the country."In these difficult circumstances that the country is passing through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to leave the position of the presidency. He has commissioned the armed forces council to direct the issues of the state," said the vice president of Egypt, Omar Suleiman. Both houses of parliament and the cabinet are expected to be suspended following Mubarak's resignation the BBC reports, quoting Al-Arabiya.In response to the resignation, Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei stated that "This is the greatest day of my life.

[[America Online]]True DEMOCRACY is when the people govern their destiny and those how govern fearing them as it is the case with Egypt. Sadly the United State is using this historical in Egypt for propaganda around the world. The US portraits itself as the nation of democracy, let¡¯s see if it¡¯s true. We see how the United State government speaks about democratic principles while it maintains the people of the US ignorant of the true meaning of democracy. Every day President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary the press speaks about this historical event and how the Egyptian Government should listen to their people. President Obama and Secretary Clinton use world like freedom, human right violation, dictatorship, democracy, freedom of the press, etc., these are worlds they have no clue of their true meaning. In 2008, they went to the island of Puerto Rico to campaign for the United State Presidential election. They use Puerto Rican¡¯s public funds for their campaign which is unlawful under the Puerto Rican Constitution, of course, a Constitution drafted by the United State Congress and imposed on the Puerto Rican¡¯s people in 1952. The truth is, not one United Sate Citizen, while in the island of Puerto Rico can vote for any President of the USA, not even George Washington if alive today can vote for the President of the United State. Talk about democratic principles.  Since 1898, every President of the USA has spoken secretly about the people of Puerto Rico and their political status. The United Nation recognizes Puerto Rico as the older colony in the world living under the imperial rule of the United State (United Nation General Assembly resolution 1514. We must not forget that while the United State goes immoral underwear around the world preaching democracy, that the world knows in what oppressive status the people of Puerto Rico are living. The world knows that the United State of America violates human rights in Puerto Rico and commits genocide in the island of Puerto Rico. The people in Puerto Rico know that the USA Coast Guard and the Central Intelligence Agency turns a blind eye on the smuggling of arms and drugs brought into Puerto Rico. Today the US Government presses on the puppets, that how they are call in the island, to suppress freedom of the press and deny any demonstration related to any democratic principles. Here in the United State no news paper, radio or television is permitted to talk about the United Nation and the situation with Puerto Rico. The threat of losing their jobs and license is there. We must use every mean available to educate ourselves and learn about Democracy in the United State, only then we can regain the image of a true DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY and be once again the world Shining Star . Knowing that by talking openly about democracy in the United State I am targeted by those who governs the United State of America. The youth of Egypt are showing the world what power true democracy has. Everything can be done without bloodshed or killing. Now, the youth of the world can see and learn, once the will of the people is united democracy is born.

[[Pakistani court seeks Musharraf's arrest over Bhutto murder]]A court in Pakistan has issued an arrest warrant for exiled former President Pervez Musharraf. He is accused of involvement in the 2007 assassination of rival and ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto while in power.Currently in Dubai and residing in London, UK, Musharraf has been given until February 19 to appear before Rawalpindi's anti-terror court. If he does not, the court says it will declare him a wanted fugitive and the government has suggested Interpol could be called upon to assist with extradition.Bhutto served from 1988¨C1990 and 1993¨C1996 as Prime Minister. In December 2007 her election motorcade was attacked using guns and a suicide bomb, killing her. Last year two senior policemen were arrested on allegations they provided insufficient protection; prosecutors say the duo claimed they removed security from Bhutto's motorcade just before it set off from a speaking engagement in Rawalpindi on Musharraf's orders. The attack came soon after.Her party, the {w|Pakistan People's Party}, won a majority in the subsequent election and her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, is the current President. In 2008, Musharraf resigned under threat of impeachment. He had seized power from elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999 after a coup from his role as army chief. Growing dissatisfaction over both foreign and domestic policy led to demonstrations until he called the elections.The ex-President's lawyer Mohammad Saif refuted the allegations. "This is just a drama. It is all politics," he said, adding Musharraf was innocent and would not be appearing in court. The former dictator has not commented publically but denied involvement. He has not been indicted and the court says Musharraf has the chance to defend himself as it conducts preliminary hearings on the claims. His position is that the accusations are a smear campaign led by Zardari. He blamed the {w|Pakistani Taliban} for the attack at the time; they deny involvement but lead prosecutor Zulfikar Chaudhry said the Taliban was the source of information showing Musharraf was "completely involved.""A joint investigation team, in its report to the court, has found Musharraf guilty of being involved in the conspiracy," said Chaudhry, who is seeking a murder trial. No extradition treaty exists with Britain, but authorities there do decide on case-by-case requests.Prosecutors contend he was fully aware of the plot in advance. They claim a questionaire was sent to his London home and multiple attempts were made to get in touch, to no avail. Now, investigators say, no further progress can be made without Musharraf.== Sources == 
[[Algiers protest takes place despite ban]]A planned pro-democracy protest took place Saturday in Algiers, the capital of Algeria, despite a standing government ban on protests in the capital.  Massive police presence reduced the event from its planned scope, and dispersed it after a few hours, but did not prevent it.The demonstration, planned for some time, was to be a march through Algiers, from May First Square, about five kilometers to Martyrs Square.  Instead, protesters demonstrated in May First Square for a few hours.Algeria has been officially in a state of emergency for nineteen years.  Early this month, following recent pro-democracy events in Tunisia and Egypt, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said the state of emergency will be lifted "soon".  At the same time he also said marches would be allowed everywhere in the country except in Algiers.  Leading up to this protest, riot police closed all entrances both to Algiers and to May First Square.The number of demonstrators who gathered in May First Square despite the police cordons was estimated by officials at 1500, and by demonstration organizers at around 10,000.  The number of riot police in the city ¡ª with body armor, armored vehicles, and water cannons ¡ª was anticipated by officials as high as 30,000, and estimated by organizers as high as 26,000.The protest was organized by the National Co-ordination for Change and Democracy, an umbrella group of Algerian organizations formed in late January.  Protesters demanded democratic freedoms, an end to government corruption, and relief from economic hardships.  Some protesters called for removal of President Bouteflika, although that was not a stated goal of the organizers.Several hundred protesters were arrested, at least briefly.  Algerian activist Elias Felali, who blogged from within the demonstration, claimed the police wanted to provoke violence, but the protesters were pointedly non-violent.== Sources ==

[[UK inflation rate increases to 4%]]The {w|Office for National Statistics|Office for National Statistics} have made a statement saying the inflation rate of the United Kingdom measured by the {w|Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index} increased to 4% in January 2011. In December 2010, this figure was 3.7%. According to {w|BBC News Online}, 4% is the highest CPI that the UK has experienced since November 2008.There are various reasons for the raised British inflation rate, including {w|Value added tax|value added tax} increasing from 17.5% to 20% on January 4 and the value of {w|crude oil} rising. The inflation rate of the {w|Retail Price Index} in the country has increased to 5.1%; previously, the value was 4.8%. The CPI has now been a minimum of a percentage point higher than the intended 2% target for one year and two months.The ONS revealed that the price of {w|Gasoline|petrol} per litre, which the CPI measured at {w|Pound sterling|?}1.27, was a record peak. The rising values of tobacco, alcohol, hotels, restaurants, transport and furniture are also said to have caused the increase in VAT. Between December 2010 and January 2011, the rate of the CPI increased by 0.1%, the first time that inflation rose during these two months since records commenced in 1997. The ONS have stated that "[t]wo of the main factors that had an impact on the January data are the increase in the standard rate of Value Added Tax to 20% and the continued increase in the price of crude oil"."The MPC's central judgement, under the assumption that Bank rate increases in line with market expectations, remains that inflation will fall back so that it is about as likely to be above the target as below it two to three years ahead," Mervyn King stated in the letter. "The MPC judges that attempting to bring inflation back to the target quickly risks generating undesirable volatility in output and would increase the chances of undershooting the target in the medium term."During the last week, the UK interest rates remained at 0.5%. The {w|Bank of England} has kept this figure at half a percent for twenty-three consecutive months.

[[Egyptian military appoints committee to amend constitution]]Egypt's ruling military council has appointed a committee to amend the Egyptian constitution.  The committee held its first meeting Tuesday with the president of the military council.  The committee is to complete its work within ten days, with a referendum on the amended constitution to take place within two months.The committee has eight members, mostly constitutional law experts.  The head of the committee is {w|Tareq El-Beshry}, a respected retired judge noted for his independent positions.  Another member is lawyer Sobhi Saleh, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is the largest opposition group in Egypt although officially illegal.The Muslim Brotherhood has never been classified as a terrorist organization by the United States government, but some people in the US see it as a radical religious group.  The Brotherhood has officially said it "envisions the establishment of a democratic, civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice, with central Islamic values serving all Egyptians regardless of colour, creed, political trend or religion".  The Brotherhood announced Tuesday it will apply for political party status, but will not field a candidate for president in elections to replace former President Hosni Mubarak as that might be divisive.  "It's time for solidarity, it's time for unity, in my opinion we need a national consensus", said a Brotherhood senior leader, Essam el-Arian.Amr El-Chobaki, of {w|Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies}, remarked about the appointment of a Brotherhood member to the committee, "I could have been concerned if there were no other [political] currents represented in the committee, which is not the case ... The Brotherhood is an existing [political] current and it is normal that it is represented [in such a committee]".Hosni Mubarak gave control of the country to the military when he stepped down on Friday after three decades of rule.  Mubarak had amended the constitution while in power, to consolidate his position, including various measures affecting parliamentary elections.  On Sunday, the ruling military council dissolved both houses of parliament and suspended the constitution.According to Atef El-Banna, a member of the current amending committee and professor of constitutional law at Cairo University, an entirely new constitution would not be practical at this time.  "A new constitution requires a committee elected by the people to put it", El-Banna said.== Sources == 
[[Yale University builds world's first anti-laser]]A team at {w|Yale University} in the US has built the world's first {w|anti-laser} ¡ª or coherent perfect absorber. The device, constructed from {w|silicon}, absorbs light and dissipates the energy as heat.Professor Hui Cao's researchers were following on from theoretical work last year by Professor Douglas Stone. Stone explained "we were working on a theory that could predict what could be used to form a laser," and the theory also predicted the possibility of an anti-laser. Lasers amplify light to produce {w|Coherence|coherent} pulses.The new anti-laser focuses two identical laser beams towards each other. The light is trapped in an {w|optical cavity} and bounces until all the energy is converted into heat. The one constructed by Yale used a piece of silicon 110 {w|micrometer|micrometers} wide; it absorbed 99.4% of light at a wavelength of 998.5 {w|nanometer|nanometers}, which is close to {w|infrared}.Stone felt "[t]heory and experiment matched very well. We couldn't have expected to do any better." The theory suggests that 99.999% could be absorbed, but Yale blamed "experimental limitations" for not achieving this. Yale explained that more sophisticated anti-lasers may approach this absorption rate, and added that simulations suggest much smaller versions could be made.The research team believes it could have applications in {w|supercomputing}, with machines {w|optical computing|using light} and not {w|electrons} like regular computers. Many computer components are already manufactured from silicon. Since the energy is dissipated as heat, however, use is limited against {w|laser weapon|laser weapons} since the heat would damage the target anyway.General light-absorption is not difficult, according to Stone, but this is the first time a device has been built targeted to the specific-wavelength beams produced by lasers.== Sources == 
[[Australian town to change name to promote road safety]]The residents of {w|Speed, Victoria|Speed}, a small town in the south-east of Australia, have made the decision to modify the name of the town for one month in an attempt to improve road safety in the country.

However, these campaigns were in large part unsuccessful. In 2010, Australia experienced a 25% increase in deaths on rural roads . TAC spokesperson Phil Reed has stated that, with this new name change campaign, "[w]e're trying to get people to stay within the speed limits, obey road safety rules" and cause motorists to "realise that when they don't, people die".One inhabitant of Speed has also made the decision to change his name during March. Phil Down, who grows wheat and raises sheep, has decided to change his name to Phil Slow Down. Speaking to the {w|Australian Broadcasting Corporation}, Down explained: "It's virtually on the road to somewhere else, so we've taken our quirky name and run with it to bring the attention to the campaign of trying to get people to slow down on country roads and especially through small towns".== Sources == 
[[Kuwait stateless protest for rights]]A thousand or more non-citizen residents of Kuwait demonstrated yesterday demanding rights given to Kuwaiti citizens.

There are estimated to be around 100,000 non-citizen residents, called "bidoons".  Many bidoons claim descent from desert nomads who did not apply for citizenship in 1959.  Many bidoons live in economic hardship, and cannot get legal recognitions such as birth and death certificates, driver's licenses, and attested marriage contracts.Interior Ministry spokesman Adil Al-Hashash said "security forces on the ground talked to the protestors in a nice and civilized way", telling them "they should go to the legal channels for their demands rather than protesting."  The government says police acted in self-defense after protesters threw rocks.Independent Kuwaiti {w|Member of Parliament} Daifallah Buramia said "[t]he protest of bidoons is legitimate and the government is responsible for this because it has failed to resolve the problem".== Sources == 
[[Strikeforce Challengers 14 MMA Results]]Veteran striker {w|Pat Healy|Pat "Bam Bam" Healy} put an end to the undefeated streak of {w|Lyle Beerbohm|Lyle "Fancy Pants" Beerbohm} in a close main event fight that went to the judges' decision at the Strikeforce Challengers 14 event at Cedar Park Center in Cedar Park, Texas on Friday night. Veteran fighter {w|Carlo Prater|Carlo "Neo" Prater} also prevailed in his Strikeforce debut against {w|Bryan Travers}. {w|Ryan Couture}, son of MMA legend {w|Randy Couture}, remained undefeated in his second-ever bout.Lyle Beerbohm came into the main event bout with an undefeated 15-0-0 record, in addition to his 8-0-0 amateur record. "This is going to be a fun, tough, hard fight that I expect will go everywhere," stated Beerbohm in a pre-fight media workout on Wednesday. "There¡¯ll be stand-up, wrestling, a little bit of everything. My time has come and I am really looking forward to the fight." Beerbohm also stated he wanted to eventually fight for a {w|Strikeforce} Lightweight title, but recognized that he first needed to move past his veteran opponent, Pat Healey, who came into the fight with a record of 25-17-0, who was making his return to action since his loss to {w|Josh Thompson} via submission in 2010.The bout was very close, going the distance through all three rounds. While Beerbohm pushed a lot of the action, especially with grappling on the ground, Healey was able to land more effective strikes and weathered persistent take-down attempts from Beerbohm. The action was back-and-forth, neither fighter never able to clearly dominate the other. The last few minutes of the fight proved to be the best for Healey, who wore down Beerbohm's strength and left him gasping for air, allowing Healey to attempt more submissions on the ground. The three judges scored the bout 29-28, 29-28, and 29-28 to give Healey the unanimous decision win.After the match, Beerbohm was upbeat, but felt he had won the bout. "I definitely thought I won. I thought going into the third we'd each won a round, but I definitely thought I won that last round. I took the fight to him from the start. But that's what happens when you let it go to the hands of the judges." Healey complimented his opponent, "Beerbohm fought a good fight but I think I outworked and outhustled him." Healey also welcomed the idea of a rematch, stating, "He talked a lot of trash, but if he wants a rematch, I¡¯ll give him one anytime." Asked who he wanted to face next, Healey stated he wanted to fight the winner of the {w|Billy Evangelista|Billy "Cyborg" Evangelista} and {w|Jorge Masvidal|Jorge "Gamebred" Masvidal} on March 5, noting that both fighters had previously defeated his brother, Pat Healey.The co-main event for the show featured Carlo "Neo" Prater, a veteran fighter with a 25-10-1 record making his Strikeforce debut against the 14-3-0 Bryan Travers. The bout was over in just 38 seconds as Prater used his superior reach to jab Travers several times before using a trip to take Travers to the ground and submitting him with an Anaconda Choke. Prater showed a lot of emotion in his post-fight interview. "My record shows I¡¯m not a perfect fighter, but when you¡¯re down you get up," Prater said. "This was a good win, I¡¯ll get better off this fight, but I¡¯ll be right back in the gym soon."Ryan Couture, the son of MMA legend Randy "the Nature" Couture, pushed his fight record to 2-0-0 with a victory over 2-0-0 opponent Lee Higgins. Most of the first round featured very little action until Higgins attempted to take down Couture, and found himself fighting off Guillotine Choke and a D'Arce Choke in the last minute of the round. Couture dominated nearly all of the second round with superior stand-up striking and ground control. Higgins fared little better in the third, as Couture was able to put Higgins against the cage and stop Higgins' take-down attempts, and then eventually control Higgins on the ground before submitting him with a Rear Naked Choke with 20 seconds left in the bout.To round out the broadcast, Ryan Lawson defeated {w|Erik Apple} at 3:14 of Round 2 by Triangle Choke, and {w|David Douglas|David "Tarzan" Douglas} defeated Nick Gonzalez at 1:05 of Round 1 by a Rear Naked Choke submission.

[[38 killed in attack on Afghan bank]]38 people were reported dead Sunday, in a Taliban attack on a bank in {w|Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad}, Afghanistan.  The incident, orchestrated by five {w|suicide bombers|suicide bombers} disguised as policemen and soldiers, quickly escalated into a confrontation between security forces and the invaders armed with machine guns.  After a several-hour standoff, four of the five attackers detonated their bombs while the fifth was arrested by police.  A representative for the Interior Ministry told the press that "Thirty eight people were martyred which includes 21 security forces personnel and 17 civilians."  Members of the police force were apparently receiving their paychecks when the attackers entered the bank and began indiscriminately firing at guards and civilians.  70 others were also wounded.Although officials refused to itemize the casualties, they claimed that due to the random nature of the gunfire, both security personnel and civilian bankers were killed.  Attacks targeting police have become common in the {w|Nangarhar province}; this incident was the third major attack this week.== Sources == 
[[Australian Governor-General travels to Kuwait amidst terror threats]]Her Excellency, {w|Quentin Bryce}, {w|Governor General of Australia|Governor-General} of Australia is set to travel to Kuwait to commemorate the 20 year anniversary of the liberation of the country from Iraqi rule. This comes as terrorist threats and civil unrest begin to spread throughout the region.In a tour that is set to conclude on February 27th, Ms Bryce will be representing Australia at several ceremonies marking 20 years since the first {w|Gulf War} and 50 years since Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom.

[[Libya blocks access to Internet]]The Libyan government has cut off Internet access in the country. The {w|General Posts and Telecommunications Company}, Libya's main provider of Internet access, has ceased to function. It was shut down following citizen protests against the country's leader, Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, who has been in power since 1969.The government of Egypt took a similar measure last month, when it cut off Internet trying to quell public protests against the regime. Despite the government's efforts, Egyptians who took to the streets for two weeks were able to oust the nation's president, Hosni Mubarak, after 30 years in office.Limited access to the Internet makes it difficult to get information from the country. Libya is a country with a smaller population than Egypt, and has fewer service providers, which has apparently made the task of disconnecting everything a little easier.In Egypt, the military refused to attack people protesting. The situation is different in Libya, where the armed forces attacked hundreds of demonstrators in the square of the city of Benghazi, causing many deaths.The increasing violence in Libya has prompted the 27 European Union ministers to issue a statement protesting Libyan governmental violence toward protesters, saying it "condemns the ongoing repression against demonstrators in Libya and deplores the violence and death of civilians." Two Libyan pilots have defected to Malta and asked for asylum, saying that they were ordered to fire on protesters, according to Maltese officials. The violence has spread to Tripoli. Witnesses have reported that a "massacre" occurred today in suburbs of the Libyan capital with the indiscriminate shooting of women and children.  According to {w|Human Rights Watch}, hundreds have died over the last four days. The escalating violence is causing turbulence in the world energy markets. The International Monetary Fund says that energy exports accounts for approximately 95% of Libya's export earning.

At least 75 people have been killed by collapsing buildings in central {w|Christchurch}, with more feared. Mayor {w|Bob Parker|Bob Parker} said 55 bodies had been identified and there were a further 20 unidentified bodies. The spire of the iconic Anglican {w|ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral} has fallen and rubble is strewn throughout the central business district. Roads and carparks have cracked and lifted, and two buses are reported to be crushed under the bus exchange. Pools of mud have erupted due to burst water mains and liquefaction.  Boulders and falling cliff faces have destroyed buildings on hillside suburbs.  Fears for the safety of nearby towns Lyttelton and Akaroa are exacerbated due to communication problems.The earthquake was centred near {w|Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch}, at a depth of five kilometres, according to the {w|United States Geological Survey}. Unlike previous quakes in the region that caused no fatalities, Tuesday quake was shallower and closer to the central city and the damage was much worse. Condemned buildings, weakened by last year's widespread earthquakes, were destroyed. Some aftershocks have occurred in the area after the earthquake. The largest so far was a magnitude 5.6 which occurred at 7:04 p.m. February 21 {w|Eastern Time Zone|EDT}. Mayor Bob Parker has stated that as many as 25 major buildings in the city are destroyed. Urban Search and Rescue efforts are focussed on people trapped in the remains of Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation office buildings. The historic {w|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament} in Christchurch has half collapsed, while the old Canterbury Provincial Chambers building, Piko Wholefoods, and a church on Durham Street have been destroyed.The earthquake also caused an estimated 30 million tons of ice to break off of the Tasman Glacier forming icebergs in a lake near its foot. Tourists on boats at the time of the quake say waves of 3.5 meters swept the lake for at least 30 minutes following the event. The glacier sits on the country's west coast, approximately 120 miles from Christchurch. No injuries were reported.Many people are trapped in damaged buildings or under rubble, but emergency services have been hampered by gridlock as motorists and pedestrians evacuated the CBD. The main hospital remains operational despite one damaged ward being closed, and three triage centres have been set up to provide medical aid. Several hundred delegates attending a medical conference in the city, the great majority from Australia, have been trapped in the city; some of these are assisting with tending to the injured.Electricity, telephone services, and traffic lights suffered widespread outages. Orion and Telecom are attempting to assess the damage, and generators have been sent down from Auckland to replace the backup generators in the city. Civil Defence is mounting a response with all available national resources, and Cabinet is holding an emergency session. Speaking to {w|Radio New Zealand}, {w|Mayor of Christchurch|Mayor} {w|Bob Parker|Bob Parker} said he was "thrown quite a distance", that there were scenes of "great confusion" on the streets, and that the quake was "as violent as the one that happened on the 4th of September". The emergency telephone code, 111 was not working for the entire region of {w|Southland, New Zealand} but is apparently stable as of approx. 4 pm {w|NZDT}. Christchurch Airport is currently closed to all but emergency flights. Speaking after the earthquake, Bob Parker said at least 200 people are believed trapped under rubble, saying that New Zealand are "going to be presented with statistics that are going to be bleak".
[[Egyptian man names daughter 'Facebook']]An Egyptian man in his early twenties has named his newborn daughter 'Facebook' following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution which was almost solely organized on the social-networking site Facebook.  The father, Gamal Ibrahim, told the Egyptian newspaper {w|Al-Ahram} that he gave his child the name to "express his joy at the achievements made by the January 25 youth."

'Facebook' received many gifts from the youth who were overjoyed by her arrival and the new name. A name that shocked the entire world."The Egyptian spelling of 'Facebook' is ??? ???.== Sources == 
[[Australian Governor-General travels to Kuwait admidst Terror Threats]]Prohibition party? Where did this guy come from Saudi Arabia. Prohibition is against free will, the human spirit, is expensive and the social costs of enforcement, imprisonment, and violence related to organized crime are enormous. It was tried in the '30's and was a complete disaster. The US already alone imprisons more people in sheer number and as well per capita than any other nation in the entire world. The war on drugs is a massive failure and prohibition of the earlier part of the last century was seen as one of the bloodiest and costliest mistakes in all of political history. Now we have this clown trying to bring it back? The US isn't a democracy, its a a neo-feudalistic republic which as shameful as it is at least it gives lunatics like this no chance in hell to achieve anything. Heck even in a pure proportionate representational system without a minimum threshold this clown wouldn't even get elected!I should start a party, its only policy would be to run prohibitionists like this moron out of the country and I would get way more live and votes than this goof didler!   Michal from Slovakia, where we treat prohibitionists like Colombian soccer players who accidentally score on their own goal post. By the way, I don't drink alcohol either!

Protests have spread to Tripoli as Muammar Gaddafi has made no signs of stepping down from his 35-year rule as leader of Libya.Aboul Gheit told media at a news conference "Regarding east of Libya, the Benghazi airport runways have been destroyed. It is not possible for Egyptair flights or any other flights to land in that airport." He added "If Egyptians need to leave, and I always advise [them] to stay home, then they would have to travel to Egyptian borders by land some 500km in proximity to danger. Such trips must be in groups and in buses."Egypt is currently awaiting permission to land at {w|Tripoli Airport}. Aboul Gheit compared the situation to the evacuation of Egyptian nationals from Iraq in 1991 during the outbreak of the Iraq war. Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands have all sent transport planes to bring their nationals back home.
[[Pirates kill four American hostages]]According to {w|KYW-TV|CBS 3}, the four Americans taken hostage after their yacht was hijacked by pirates off the coast of Oman in the {w|Indian Ocean} have been killed.

[[Bahrain Grand Prix cancelled amid political turmoil]]A week after Sunni & Shi'ite youth protesters marched on the capital city of Manama, the Bahrain government informed Formula One Management that it would withdraw from hosting the {w|Bahrain Grand Prix}. The decision was made in an effort to focus on the pressing national issues facing the country. Demonstrators, who are still holding Pearl Square, had threatened to target the Media attention if the event went ahead as scheduled. The race is the opening event of the 2011 Formula One racing season.Bahrain's Crown Prince, HRH {w|Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa}, sent a statement to {w|Formula One Group|Formula One Management} which said, "At the present time the country¡¯s entire attention is focused on building a new national dialogue for Bahrain. After the events of the past week, our nation¡¯s priority is on overcoming tragedy, healing divisions and rediscovering the fabric that draws this country together; reminding the world of the very best that Bahrain is capable of as a nation once again united."The Bahrain Grand Prix was to be held on March 13, with teams coming in within the next few weeks to prepare for the race. Formula One president and CEO {w|Bernie Ecclestone} issued a public statement saying, "It is sad that Bahrain has had to withdraw from the race, we wish the whole nation well as they begin to heal their country." Ecclestone also noted that despite reported rumors, the {w|Bahrain International Circuit} would not be charged for their cancellation of the event, citing that he considered the political unrest to be a "force majeure" and that the events that took place could not have been predicted. "What has happened in Bahrain is desperately sad but one month ago everyone was looking forward to the race," he said. Formula One Management will most likely have to absorb the costs related to the canceled race, estimated at around $40 million, unless it can be re-scheduled later in the season.With the announcement from the Crown Prince that political issues would be addressed, exiled Shi'ite political leader {w|Hassan Mushaima} announced that he would return to the country.

[[Opposition Leader predicts 'people's revolt' in Australia over carbon tax]]Leader of the Federal Opposition in Australia Tony Abbott has made claims Thursday during {w|Question Time} in parliament that a 'people's revolt' is looming based on the Prime Minister Julia Gillard's proposal for a 2012 carbon tax.In what Mr. Abbott describes as a "betrayal of the Australian people", Ms. Gillard announced Thursday that a price for carbon will be put back on the national agenda, for several years, to be followed by the formation of an emissions trading scheme. In the lead up to the 2010 Federal Australian Election, Ms. Gillard claimed that while she might implement a green house gas reduction scheme, "[she would] rule out a carbon tax".The price on carbon will be applied to industrial and transport emissions but will not, however, affect Australia's agriculture.  The Prime Minister's announcement resulted in a large portion of Question Time being devoted to the issue with a Member of the Opposition being expelled from the House for disorderly conduct. Mr. Abbot then moved to censure the Prime Minister and conclude Question Time claiming "Nothing is more fake than making a promise to the Australian people before the election and breaking it after the election ... I don't believe it's going to happen because I think there will be a people's revolt. They will see this as an assault on their standard of living, which is exactly what it is".To which the Prime Minister responded "Increasingly Australians understand that the {w|Liberal party of Australia| Liberal Party}, under the Leader of the Opposition, is a party of the past with no real policies or plans for the nation's future ... You get judged ultimately in this Parliament by what you decide to do and what you deliver, and on this side of the Parliament we are determined that from July 1 we will price carbon."The Opposition claims that the proposed carbon tax will cause petrol prices to rise by {w|Australian dollar|A$}0.065 per litre while energy bills may increase by $300 per year.== Sources == 
[[Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to be extradited to Sweden]]Today, a British court ordered Julian Assange, founder of the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, to be extradited to Sweden. Assange, a 39 year old Australian, has been accused by two Swedish women of sexual assaults against them.Assange's lawyers have the option of appealing against this decision, and have decided to do so. Assange has denied the claims of sexual abuse, claiming the allegations to be politically motivated because his website recently published secret US diplomatic cables. Earlier, during the hearing, Assange claimed that rape cases in Sweden were "tried in secret behind closed doors in a flagrant denial of justice", and termed the country "the Saudi Arabia of feminism."Judge Howard Riddle, in his verdict, declared the allegations made by the two Swedish women a valid reason for extradition and also attested the validity of Sweden's demand to send Assange to the country for further questioning. Geoffrey Robertson QC, lawyer for Assange, suggested the latter could be extradited to the United States, on charges concerning the release of 250,000 US diplomatic cables by Wikileaks, where he could be sentenced to death penalty. His Swedish counterpart, Clare Montgomery QC, stated that while Assange's trial would be held in private, the arguments raised in the trial would be released to the public. She also assured that Sweden was going to provide "protection" against the alleged risk of Assange's extradition to the US, terming it as a "threat and violation." The European Court of Human Rights has also agreed to intervene if Assange was subjected to an "inhuman or degrading treatment or an unfair trial" in the US, she added.Assange had been granted bail in December, but has been electronically monitored ever since.Assange has been accused of raping a sleeping woman, during his visit to Stockholm last year. Another woman has alleged that the Wikileaks founder sexual assaulted her thrice. If the Swedish court declares him guilty, he could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.Paul Stephens, the Australian ambassador to Sweden, had earlier written to the country's Justice Minister, appealing that if Assange was extradited, his hearing "would proceed in accordance with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law, as well as applicable European and international laws, including relevant human rights norms."Assange is likely to remain in custody, since bail is not granted in Sweden before a trial or the accused being released.== Sources ==

[[Space Shuttle Discovery launches on final mission]]At 4:53 p.m., {w|Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle Discovery} took off from the {w|Kennedy Space Center} in Florida on its final mission, {w|STS-133}. Its mission is to deliver and install onto the International Space Station, the {w|Permanent Multipurpose Module|Permanent Multipurpose Module Leonardo}, the {w|ExPRESS Logistics Carrier|ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4} and provide critical spare components for the station. Six astronauts, Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Alvin Drew, Nicole Stott, Michael Barratt, and Steve Bowen, are participating in the mission. The shuttle is also carrying {w|Robonaut|Robonaut2}, the first dexterous humanoid robot to be in space. Although its first priority will be to test its operation in microgravity, upgrades could eventually allow it to fulfill its ultimate purpose of becoming an astronaut helper on boring or dangerous tasks. The launch of Discovery, which was supposed to occur at 4:50 p.m., was delayed for three minutes due to a technical problem in the shuttle's command system and a chipped heat shield tile near the crew hatch which needed to be patched. The launch was also repeatedly postponed since November 1 due to various technical problems with the shuttle's systems and a hydrogen leak in the fuel tank along with cracks and bad weather. A small piece of foam broke off during the launch but NASA has reported that it is unlikely to cause problems. Discovery and the crew of STS-133 are scheduled to spend about two weeks in space and aboard the ISS, logging 4.5 million additional miles of flight.The launch comes just hours after an unmanned automated European cargo spacecraft, {w|Johannes Kepler ATV|ATV-2}, docked with the orbiting outpost to deliver supplies and equipment to the crew.STS-133 is scheduled to be the final mission of Discovery, with its first being {w|STS-41-D} in 1984. Discovery flew 39 flights in its operational history, including the current mission, delivering several payloads to space including the {w|Hubble Space Telescope} and visiting two different space stations: {w|Mir|Mir} and the ISS. STS-133 is the 133rd shuttle mission and the 35th mission to the ISS. Discovery is the oldest surviving shuttle, and has flown more missions than any other shuttle. It was also the first shuttle to fly after the {w|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster} and was the first shuttle to fly after the {w|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster}. Later, Discovery became the {w|STS-60|first shuttle to fly a Russian cosmonaut}. After the current mission, there will be at most two remaining shuttle flights. {w|Endeavour|Endeavor} has one more mission remaining, and if an emergency rescue is needed or more funding is secured, {w|Atlantis|Atlantis} will also fly once more before the entire fleet is retired."The shuttle has provided an amazing capacity for this country to gather data. I think we¡¯re still sorting through a lot of it, trying to figure out what all we¡¯ve learned from it. This chapter in our space history known as the space shuttle has been incredible," said Bryan Lunney, lead space shuttle flight director for the mission.== Sources == 
[[France calls on Libyan leader to step down]]French president Nicolas Sarkozy has stated during a news conference that Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi "must leave," calling the leader to step down. His comments were made during a press conference with the Turkish president {w|Abdullah G¨¹l} in {w|Ankara}. Sarkozy also stated that military action to remove Gaddafi isn't ruled out."Our stance is clear. Mr Gaddafi must go. The systematic violence against the Libyan people is unacceptable and will be the subject of investigations and sanctions. Regarding a military intervention ... France would consider any initiative of this type with extreme caution and reserve," said Sarkozy. The United Kingdom is also calling for an arms embargo along with an investigation into war crimes be conducted against Gaddafi.Sarkozy's call on Gaddafi to step down comes after violence on Friday alone has left at least five people dead in Tripoli, the capitol of Libya, when security personnel fired on demonstrators. At least 500 people are suspected to have been killed in Tripoli with over 2,000 injured. Gunshots were heard in several parts of the city on Friday. Navi Pillay, head of the human rights division of the United Nations says thousands in Libya could have been killed since the uprising began. Human Rights Watch puts the death toll at 300."We think this needs to be brought to the International Criminal Court. We also think that people who still cooperate with Gadhafi should be punished," added Sarkozy.Reports say security forces loyal to Gaddafi have used rocket propelled grenades, snipers, anti aircraft guns and foreign mercenaries to repel protesters. Gaddafi blames {w|Osama bin Laden} and people on hallucinogenic drugs for the mass  protests in the country. " ages are 17. They give them pills at night, they put hallucinatory pills in their drinks, their milk, their coffee, their Nescafe," he said on Thursday.In a speech that aired on Libyan State TV today, Gaddafi said to supporters in Green Square in Tripoli, "We can defeat any aggression if necessary and arm the people. Prepare to defend the nation and defend the oil. [We can] retaliate against them [the opposition]. You, the youth, be comfortable... dance, sing, stay up all night."
[[Candle knocked over during voodoo sex ritual causes apartment fire]]An elderly {w|Brooklyn}, New York woman was found dead yesterday after a fire triggered by a voodoo ceremony caused a blaze in an apartment that left dozens homeless. The details of the ceremony were not clear, but  sources say it  led to sex.An unidentified woman hired a {w|Voodoo} priest for $300, identified as Nelson Pierre, to perform a mystic ceremony  meant to bring her good luck.  The woman went to  Pierre's apartment, where she ended up in bed surrounded by  lit candles which were mistakenly knocked over,  setting the bedsheets on fire.  In an effort to suppress the flames, Pierre splashed water from the bathroom sink on the sheets while his roommate, who was ironing at the time,  opened a window for air.  However, according to the {w|New York Fire Department}, wind gusting through the open window created a "blowtorch effect" which caused the fire to spread to the 4th floor hallway and into the 5th and 6th floors.  The blaze killed one woman, three others were severely injured, and at least 20 firefighters were left with burn wounds.In an NYFD statement, Fire Commissioner {w|Salvatore J. Cassano} said, "Time and time again we respond to tragedies that could have been so easily prevented.  This fire had so many of those elements ... hopefully others will learn from this tragedy."  It took hours for hundreds of firemen from dozens of companies to bring the raging fire under control.Pierre, a man in his 60s, did not call {w|9-1-1|911} right away, but attempted to quell the fire  using water from the bathroom sink.  A source in law enforcement said, "Nobody sees a crime right now.  It was an accident.

[[Space Shuttle Discovery arrives at International Space Station]]The {w|Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle Discovery}, flying the {w|STS-133} mission, has successfully rendezvoused and docked with the International Space Station today at 18:14 UTC for what is scheduled to be the final time in its career.Discovery is delivering six astronauts to the orbiting outpost, as well as station parts and supplies including the {w|Permanent Multipurpose Module|Permanent Multipurpose Module Leonardo}, the {w|ExPRESS Logistics Carrier|ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4} and {w|Robonaut|Robonaut2}, the first dexterous humanoid robot in space.The docking, Discovery's 13th and final scheduled docking, occurred two minutes ahead of schedule, having been originally scheduled for 19:16 GMT today.The hatch between the space shuttle and the ISS was opened at 20:16 UTC, after which the crew members of {w|Expedition 26|Expedition 26} welcomed the crew of STS-133 aboard the station. The crew then participated in a safety briefing with Expedition 26 commander {w|Scott J. Kelly|Scott Kelly}, while Shuttle Flight Director Bryan Lunney took part in a mission status briefing on the ground which began at 20:50 UTC.Later on today, crew members {w|Nicole P. Stott|Nicole Stott} and {w|Michael R. Barratt|Michael Barratt} are scheduled to move the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4 from the payload bay using the shuttle's robotic arm to the station's own robot arm for placement on the exterior of the orbital laboratory.There was a delay in the docking mechanism's ability to make a seal between the two spacecraft during docking operations, so activities occurring later on in the day, including the transfer of ELC-4, may be delayed. This was primarily because of a mis-alignment between the docking systems of the shuttle and station due to gravitational effects. The entire delay took up approximately 40 minutes.During Discovery's approach to the station earlier on today, the crew of Expedition 26 took pictures of the shuttle's underside from the station's windows in order to assist in analysis of the heat shield of the spacecraft.NASA officials are debating whether or not to extend the mission an additional day for a photo shoot of the International Space Station, as it is currently host to six docked spacecraft from the United States, Russia, Europe, and Japan. A decision regarding this possibility is expected on Tuesday.STS-133 is Space Shuttle Discovery's 39th and final scheduled mission into space and the program's 35th mission to the ISS, as well as the 133rd in the entire {w|Space Shuttle Program|Shuttle Program}. There are two flights remaining before the retirement of the fleet that are still in planning: {w|STS-134|STS-134} and {w|STS-135|STS-135}.

Officials cited concerns relating to health and safety.A {w|Westminster City Council} spokeswoman explained that two complaints made by members of the public were being replied to by the council. The Icecreamists, the marketing company involved with the dessert known as 'Baby Gaga', are fully co-operating with officials who are carrying out tests that are currently ongoing.

[[Telecom Commission of Solomon Islands issues phone company US$1M fine]]The Telecommunications Commission of the Solomon Islands have issued a fine to a Papua New Guinea mobile phone provider, for failing to meet the deadlines set out in the terms of its license.  bemobile, the second mobile network service provider in the Solomon Islands, was supposed to have covered 50% of the Solomons by September 2010 and 75% by February 1st 2011.  Both targets passed with their requirements unfulfilled.The National Statistics Office and the TCSI investigated claims by bemobile that it had covered 64% of the Islands, but found the claims were incorrect.  As a result, the TCSI have now issued a fine of {money|PGK|2.6|USD|1|GBP|0.61|EUR|0.72|units=m} to the company for breaking its operating license.This is the second time bemobile failed to meet its contractual obligations, and the Telecommunications Commissioner, Nicholas Williams, made it clear that they had fallen short of the target, despite being given time to sort the issue out.Williams said, "TCSI has found that bemobile has failed to meet its third coverage threshold of 75% of the population that commenced on 1 February 2011, as well as during the 14-day rectification period that was provided for under the licence."  Commissioner Williams also stated he could have raised the fine to US$2.5M, but he hoped that bemobile would use the extra money to meet its September deadline.In a statement to the Commission, bemobile admitted it had not built any new transmitter masts since the latter part of 2010.== Sources ==

[[Apple Inc. unveils iPad 2]]Hi all. I've got a question. I had to do a long homework on the reconstruction of Pichilemu last November. I had prepared some material for it, but the Wikinews article missed the most important part: the interview with the Mayor, which eventually took place on November 26, 2010, almost a month after the article was published. I even filmed the interview with him, is there any possibility that the interview is still newsworthy enough to translate, and put it on Wikinews as a follow-up article? Thanks!

[[Egyptian prime minister steps down; armed forces appoint former transport minister to position]]Shafik was appointed to his position by then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Egypt anti-government protests, not long before Mubarak decided to resign as  president on February 11, 2011. Meanwhile, a number of his cabinet ministers have retained their positions. Shafik had received criticism for his negative attitude towards young protesters and his "inadequate vision", according to the {w|Los Angeles Times}.In response to the announcement of Shafik's resignation, {w|Wael Ghonim}, a {w|Google} executive, credited with organizing the first demonstration and a former political prisoner, wrote on Twitter, a micro-blogging website, "Power to the people!" During the Egyptian protests, one of the key demands of the protesters was that Shafik step down  from his acting minister status. {w|Mohamed ElBaradei}, another pro-democracy activist and co-recipient of the {w|Nobel Peace Prize}, tweeted on Twitter that Egypt is "on the right track." {HYS question left|Did Ahmed Shafik make the correct decision to resign? Is Essam Sharaf the right person to be prime minister?}The statement released by the Council also announced {w|Essam Sharaf} as the new prime minister. "The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces decided to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq and appointed Essam Sharaf to form the new government," the armed forces  said on social networking website Facebook.Sharaf formerly held the position as the {w|Ministry of Transportation|Minister of Transportation}. The Los Angeles Times reports that he departed from that position five years ago, during the aftermath of numerous train collisions in which the Egyptian government was accused of carelessness.Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was considered {w|Persona non grata|persona non grata} by Egypt on Monday, as was his family. According to {w|BBC News Online}, Mubarak is not in the good health and has yet  been  seen or heard from in public  since his resignation.Despite having achieved one of their aims, protesters intend to continue demonstrating with mass rallies on Friday because all their demands have yet to be met. The removal of a current emergency law is amongst those demands. The law allows the Egyptian government to place people under arrest without charges brought against them. In a statement, the January 25 Youth Coalition said that they "still demand a specific time frame to achieve the rest of the revolution's basic demands." The protesters also continue to request the removal of ministers with ties to the old regime.
[[US Supreme Court upholds right to picket military funerals]]The United States Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the {w|First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment} protects the free speech rights of an anti-gay church that pickets the funerals of U.S. soldiers, even if they use hateful and offensive language.In an 8 to 1 decision, the Court upheld a lower court's ruling that struck down an award of {w|United States dollar|US}$5 million to a slain soldier's father, Albert Snyder. Snyder had sued {w|Fred Phelps} and the {w|Westboro Baptist Church} of {w|Topeka, Kansas|Topeka}, Kansas for  picketing the funeral of his son, 20-year-old Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder who was killed in Iraq in 2006. Snyder said the protest caused him emotional pain and turned his son's funeral into a "circus." The protest was well publicized, a {w|SWAT|SWAT team} was called, and the funeral procession was diverted away from the protesters, who carried signs such as "Thank God for Dead Soldiers," "God Hates Fags" and "America Is Doomed." The funeral itself was not disturbed and it was carried out on public land, following local laws. Snyder learned of the content of the slogans only later on television.Snyder's son was not a {w|Homosexuality|homosexual}. The church pickets military soldiers' funerals because they believe that the United States is too tolerant of homosexuality and that the death of U.S. soldiers is divine retribution. They have picketed more than 600 funerals. The Court's decision rested in part on the basis that the subject of the church's speech related to controversial public issues and was not a private attack on Snyder. "[The church] conducted its picketing peacefully on matters of public concern at a public place adjacent to a public street," Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in his opinion for the court. "Such space occupies a special position in terms of First Amendment protection." Roberts said that large number of protests conducted by the church against many groups, including Catholics and Jews, is evidence that Phelps and his church were not personally attacking Snyder, but were "expressing deeply held views on public topics." Roberts wrote, "As a nation we have chosen ... to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate."Snyder was disappointed in the ruling: "My first thought was eight justices don't have the common sense God gave a goat. We found out today we can no longer bury our dead in this country with dignity."== Sources == 
[[US World War II veteran Leonard Lomell dies aged 91]]Former United States soldier and World War II veteran {w|Leonard Lomell} died on Tuesday at the age of 91, his family revealed on Thursday. Lomell was awarded  the {w|Distinguished Service Cross|Distinguished Service Cross} for his actions on June 6th, 1944, also known as {w|D-Day}. As a platoon leader in the US Army's {w|2nd Ranger Battalion}, Lomell and other men climbed sheer  cliffs to destroy German artillery.J. Mark Mutter, a historian from Lomell's hometown of {w|Toms River, New Jersey|Toms River}, said, "He was one of the greatest men of the greatest generation. He was so typical of that generation and put his medals and uniform in the attic after the war and built a whole new world".Lomell was in charge of his platoon when they were set the task of destroying five German coastal guns based at the top of {w|Pointe du Hoc} between two of the landing beaches. To get to the guns they had to climb up  100-foot cliffs, with covering fire from troops based on the ground for protection. Many of Lomell's men were either shot and killed or fell to their deaths.After Lomell and others  reached the top of the cliff and fought back the Germans, it became clear that the artillery was not where it was previously believed to be. Lomell and two other Rangers found the guns unprotected in an orchard and destroyed them using grenades and explosives. For his actions historian {w|Stephen Ambrose} said that, other than future U.S President {w|Dwight D. Eisenhower}, Lomell was the one individual most responsible for the success of D-Day.Funeral arrangements are being planned and have not yet been released.
[[Libyan government accuses three Dutch helicopter crew of transporting spies]]According to the Libyan government, the crew, consisting of two men and a woman, entered Libyan airspace "in breach of international law."  Libyan state TV says their mission was to evacuate or drop off spies. No official word has been sent from the Libyan government to the Dutch on spying charges."The aim of the helicopter mission was to drop or pick up spies on Libyan soil," said the State TV report as quoted by {w|Monsters and Critics}. The report added that there was "an international conspiracy" against Libya and Gaddafi.The Dutch Ministry of Defense said the crew was conducting a "consular evacuation" when armed men detained them when they attempted to take-off from Sirte. Marloes Visser, a ministry spokesman, said, "We heard that they are being treated well."  The ministry said there are "intensive diplomatic talks" between the two governments to negotiate the release of the crew.  Very little information has been released due to the "interests of the safety of the crew," said Hans Hillen, the Dutch defense minister.Libyan State TV aired footage, reportedly of the three crew members, along with weapons and {w|United States dollar|American money}, and a helicopter. Armed men can be seen around the helicopter, apparently celebrating its capture. The footage then shows the three crew members inside a building surrounded by plain clothed and uniformed personnel, drinking a beverage."At this moment they're being held by the Libyans, and we're doing everything in our power for a soon and safe release," added Visser. The three are the first known foreign troops detained by Gaddafi forces since the crackdown began. 
[[UK's most-read papers found to be in contempt of court]]The case dates back to November 2009, when Ryan Ward was on trial before {w|Sheffield} {w|Crown Court}, accused of murdering Craig Wass. The prosecution case was that Ward hit Wass with a brick, and no firearms allegation was made against Ward at trial, but both titles placed a photograph on their websites of Ward with a gun.The papers took the image off their sites within hours, after being ordered to do so. The trial judge, His Honour Judge Michael Murphy QC, who had previously ordered the jury not to consult the Internet, did not halt the prosecution as he felt "satisfied" the jury hadn't seen the picture. Ward was convicted.Lawyers for {w|Associated Newspapers} and {w|News Group Newspapers} ¡ª respective owners of The Daily Mail and the The Sun ¡ª had argued in their defence that using the photo posed an "insubstantial" risk of prejudice, denying contempt although accepting they made "a mistake".High Court judges Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Owen Thursday sided with Grieve and McCullough: "We conclude that the nature of the photograph created a substantial risk of prejudicing any juror who saw that photograph against the defendant Ward."Lord Justice Moses' judgment mentioned the significance of the case in regards to online publications: "The criminal courts have been troubled by the dangers to the integrity and fairness of a criminal trial, where juries can obtain such easy access to the internet and to other forms of instant communication. Once information is published on the Internet, it is difficult if not impossible completely to remove it... This case demonstrates the need to recognise that instant news requires instant and effective protection for the integrity of a criminal trial."The Daily Mail's website covered the ruling in an article in which they also offered an explanation for how they published the photograph. "[A] journalist had submitted an article about the prosecution along with the photograph by e-mail, including a warning stating the handgun should not be included in any copy of the photograph as it would prejudice the trial," it reads. "But when the story was put up online a freelance journalist, then working for the website, added the photograph without taking any legal advice."The penalties for Associated Newspapers and News Group Newspapers will be considered by the judges later.== Sources == 
[[High school basketball star dies after making game-winning shot in overtime]]Friday, {w|Fennville, Michigan|Fennville}, Michigan  high school athlete Wes Leonard, 16 years old,  suddenly collapsed on the basketball court  after making the game-winning shot in overtime. His play had cinched a perfect season for his undefeated {w|Fennville High School} basketball team before an exuberant crowd. As Leonard lay motionless on his back, the audience became silent. A witness on the court said Leonard had ceased to breathe and his heart had stopped. Attempts to revive him failed and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died a little over an hour  later. An autopsy revealed that Leonard had an {w|Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart}, causing the {w|cardiac arrest} that killed him.It is unclear from media reports whether the school had an {w|automated external defibrillator|automated external defibrillator} available for emergencies, or if the ambulance personnel had employed such equipment.  Also unknown is how much time  elapsed from the moment the player collapsed until the time a defibrillator was employed. Many  schools have acquired defibrillators for such emergencies, according to {w|Michigan High School Athletic Association} spokesman John Johnson. He said the devices at schools are not mandated  by law nor by the association's regulations. There is evidence that if, in the first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest, an  AED is used, up to 80% of the victims can survive. {w|Certified first responder|Emergency responders} usually need at least seven minutes to arrive on the scene.News media describes Leonard¡¯s death as shocking the community.  His coach described him as a  healthy and  disciplined athlete who  was the top scorer on his basketball team as well as the quarterback of the school's football team  which won its conference's championship this season.   Dr. Marc Lahiri, a specialist in disorders of heart rhythm for Detroit's {w|Henry Ford Hospital}, said that  detecting underlying heart abnormalities is difficult and such defects  may not become apparent until the occurrence of a sudden and perhaps fatal event. Lahiri said many doctors are encouraging schools to make extensive testing of the heart routine for physicals given to school athletes. Such testing is controversial, not only because of the cost but because of possible false-positives that may lead to the need for additional testing.== Sources == 
[[Microsoft waits for death of Internet Explorer 6]]With development of Microsoft's {w|Internet Explorer 9|Internet Explorer 9} browser almost complete, Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for {w|Internet Explorer 6|IE6} users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser. Microsoft has replaced it with three newer versions.  On a new website, "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown", Microsoft has  launched an aggressive  campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE. Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent."[Ten] years ago, a browser was born. Its name was Internet Explorer 6. Now that we¡¯re in 2011, in an era of modern web standards, it¡¯s time to say goodbye," Microsoft says on "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown".Internet Explorer's {w|Usage share of web browsers|market share} is slipping. IE's various versions accounted for  70 percent of the market in 2009; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today. {w|Mozilla Firefox}, its main rival,  has been actively  increasing its market share while the recently released {w|Google Chrome} is also quickly gaining users. {w|PC World|PC World}'s recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded, "Usually, Internet Explorer is the #2 browser after Firefox, but over the past 30 days it's been #3, a couple of points behind {w|Safari|Safari}-and nearly tied with Chrome. It might be a statistical blip. But if it isn't, and Chrome continues to surge, IE could fall to fourth place."  Web developers face  big problems with IE6. As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with  advanced web technology and geared to  the newest web core markup language {w|HTML5|HTML 5}, they are forced to   accommodate  older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users. Also, not mentioned on Microsoft's "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown" site, are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser  at  risk of being hacked.  The Internet security firm {w|Secunia|Secunia.com}, has said that as of March 4, 2011, IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities;  39 percent of these  are rated "highly critical". Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer  provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats.Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by  its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it. IE6 shipped with {w|Windows XP}, nearly a decade ago. But it has outlived its usefulness, and Microsoft no longer wants to support it.== Sources == 
[[US military brig officials order whistle-blowing suspect to sleep naked]]United States soldier {w|Bradley Manning}, accused of leaking US state secrets to WikiLeaks and  detained  under restrictive  conditions at the {w|United States Marine Corps|Marine} base at {w|Quantico, Virginia|Quantico}, Virginia since July 2010, was ordered Wednesday to sleep stripped of all clothing. According to his attorney, this condition was imposed because Manning made a "sarcastic quip" about the harsh conditions of his confinement.For most of the eight months he has been held there, Manning has been required to sleep only in his {w|boxer shorts} because he has been under "prevention of injury watch," according to First Lieutenant Brian Villiard, a spokesman for the Quantico facility. {w|David Edward Coombs|David Coombs}, Manning's legal representative for the upcoming court marshal, said that on Wednesday Manning complained of his clothing restrictions and joked that if he wanted to, he might be able to harm himself "with the elastic waistband of his underwear or with his flip-flops."  On Wednesday night, the brig commander determined that Manning must give up his boxer shorts also. Villiard said, "The intention is to ensure the safety and security of the detainee and make sure he is able to stand trial." Villiard, citing privacy rules designed to protect the detainees, did not explain how Manning could harm himself if allowed to wear his underwear. Coombs said Manning was not put under a {w|suicide watch} because that would have required the decision of a mental health professional. As a result of the tightening of Manning's conditions, he will be required for the indefinite future to sleep naked in his cell, and endure, according to Coombs, the "humiliation of standing naked at attention for the morning roll call".In a statement, Senator {w|John Kerry} suggested recent publicity will cast light on Manning's situation and the balance between humane treatment and suicide prevention: "I think that a lot of people are now reviewing this very, very closely, people have weighed in, myself included, I think that analyses are being made. ...  And I'm convinced that there will be real scrutiny with respect to that issue." == Sources ==

[[Che Guevara's ''Motorcycle Diaries'' companion dies]]Alberto Granado Jim¨¦nez,  the Argentinian biochemist who was {w|Che Guevara}'s companion on his transformative motorcycle trip through South America, died in {w|Havana} on Saturday, reported Cuban state television.  He was 88 and died of natural causes.The politically active Jim¨¦nez met Ernesto "Che" Guevara, then a medical student, in Hernando, Argentina where  Guevara had gone to play rugby. Both were intellectually curious and  interested in exploration. In 1951 they set out on an eight-month motorcycle trip through South American that exposed them to the poverty in which most South Americans lived. The pair worked in a {w|leprosy colony} and met wtih destitute miners and {w|indigenous people}.  Both men kept diaries which served as the basis for the  2004 film, {w|The Motorcycle Diaries|The Motorcycle Diaries}, produced by {w|Robert Redford} and directed by {w|Walter Salles}.  According to the {w|guardian.co.uk|Guardian}, "Their road trip awoke in Guevara a social consciousness and political convictions that would turn him into one of the iconic revolutionaries of the 20th century." The trip is widely believed to have inspired Guevara to go to Cuba and join  Fidel Castro in his {w|Cuban Revolution|1959 revolt} against Cuban dictator {w|Fulgencio Batista}.By the time the two men met again eight years later, Guevara was a revolutionary hero and chief of Cuba¡¯s central bank. Jim¨¦nez, who had remained in Argentina working in a clinic, accepted Guevara's invitation to move to Cuba in 1961 and founded a medical facility in {w|Santiago de Cuba|Santiago}. Later he moved to Havana where he continued his medical work. The two remained friends although they did not always agree. Jim¨¦nez rejected Guevara¡¯s belief that social reform in Latin America had to be accomplished through {w|guerrilla warfare}.The book {w|The Motorcycle Diaries|The Motorcycle Diaries}  was  published in the 1990's. Jim¨¦nez said of the book that it inspired the image of {w|Che Guevara in popular culture|the young Che as a romantic figure}.Jim¨¦nez authored the book  Traveling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary, published in 2003.

[[Former adult film actress forced to leave teaching job again]]Don Senti, interim superintendent of the district, said Myers was on administrative leave from her position at the school at her own request. Myers' request, granted "out of respect for her privacy and that of her family," came after a student inquired about her pornographic career. The district said Myers passed background checks before being hired as a teacher in 2007, but it did not know about her past until the student found out about it online, because her career in the pornography industry was legal.  A Parkway representative said the Kentucky school at which Myers last worked was contacted in 2007 to verify her references, but no mention of her suspension or stint in pornography was provided.Myers will continue to be paid until the end of the semester, at which time she is to leave the Parkway School District. "We're surprised, very surprised," said Parkway spokesperson Paul Tandy. "At the same time we feel for her and her family. We do believe she has tried to move on with her life ... Unfortunately, even though it happened fifteen years ago, [the video] is still there." According to Tandy, Dye "was concerned about the impact it would have in the building," and, on March 4, informed the school's principal of her past after being asked by the student. Myers also was the coach of the girls' volleyball at Parkway North High School.Myers previously taught at Reidland High School in {w|Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah}, Kentucky, and was suspended in 2006 after a student there discovered her pornographic career. That May, Myers defended herself, saying, "Anybody who has been in my classroom could tell you how much I love teaching and how much I love these students, and that should be what matters more than anything in my past." Known as Tericka Dye at the time, she protested against her dismissal and even appeared on the "{w|Dr. Phil|Dr. Phil}" talk show.Myers said she became involved in the adult industry after working as an impoverished exotic dancer in California.
[[Philadelphia Archdiocese suspends 21 priests for alleged sexual abuse]]According to the grand jury,  at least 37 priests had continued in their duties around children despite  "substantial evidence of abuse against them".   "We understand that accusations are not proof," the report said, "but we just cannot understand the Archdiocese's apparent absence of any sense of urgency." The grand jury  had seen the files of only  20 priests, it said, and in those cases the archdiocese had dismissed credible allegations of abuse  on trivial grounds, such as a victim failing to remember the year in which the priest served or the exact layout of the {w|rectory}.The Cardinal's initial statement in reaction to the  report denied there were any active  priests "who have an admitted or established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor against them."  However, days later, he  hired a former sex crimes prosecutor to review the personnel files of all those named in the grand jury's report.Yesterday's statement placing the 21 priests on leave came more than two weeks after the grand jury released its report. Cardinal Rigali, while apologizing for the behavior of priests abusing minors, said the leaves   were temporary  measures until full  investigations are completed. This mass suspension for sexual abuse is notable in that it is one of the largest in the history  of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. The slow response of the Philadelphia Archdiocese to sexual abuse allegations goes against the {w|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|National Conference of Catholic Bishops'} own 2004 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People which says any priest with creditable allegations should be removed immediately and investigation of the case should follow.Almost a decade ago, allegations of sexual abuse by Philadelphia priests surfaced. A grand jury report issued in 2005 detailed numerous cases of abuse allegations, some decades old,  involving Philadelphia  priests and the  efforts of their superiors to cover up the evidence. The 2011 grand jury found that the panel formed by the archdiocese to handle the complaints in the  2005 report primarily  protected the church rather than the victims.David Clohessy,  the director of the {w|Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests}, an advocacy group for survivors and their attorneys, said, "Many victims and Catholics in Philly, are left seriously wondering how effective the bishops' so-called reforms really are, if dozens and dozens of credibly accused priests in one archdiocese alone are kept in ministry for years."== Sources == 
[[Space Shuttle Discovery lands for final time]]The {w|Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle Discovery} successfully landed Wednesday at the {w|Kennedy Space Center} in Florida at 11:57 AM EST for what is scheduled to be the final time in its operational career.Upon landing, the shuttle and its six-person crew wrapped up the {w|STS-133} mission, the Discovery's 39th and final flight into space. STS-133 launched on February 24, after several launch delays since last November due to numerous technical issues. During the twelve-day mission, the crew transported supplies and parts to the International Space Station including {w|Robonaut|Robonaut2}, the first dexterous humanoid robot in space, the {w|Permanent Multipurpose Module}, and {w|ExPRESS Logistics Carrier|ExPRESS Logistics Carrier-4}.During the mission, two spacewalks were performed by astronauts {w|Stephen Bowen|Stephen Bowen} and {w|Alvin Drew} to install parts and perform maintenance on the exterior of the orbiting laboratory.Six astronauts and cosmonauts, members of the {w|Expedition 26} crew, remain aboard the ISS to carry out a long-duration mission aboard the outpost.STS-133 is Discovery's 39th and final mission into space, the 35th shuttle mission to the ISS, and the 133rd flight in the entire {w|Space Shuttle Program|shuttle program}. Discovery has docked with two different space stations, {w|Mir|Mir} and the ISS, and was the first shuttle to fly after both the {w|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger} and {w|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia disasters}. Discovery made its maiden flight on {w|STS-41-D} in 1984, having since become the most experienced and oldest surviving space shuttle, and delivering payloads to orbit such as the {w|Hubble Space Telescope} and becoming the {w|STS-60|first shuttle to fly a Russian cosmonaut into space}.Discovery, having completed its final flight, has been offered by NASA to the {w|National Air and Space Museum} of the {w|Smithsonian Institution} in Washington, D.C., to display to the public. The museum, however, is in the process of determining how to obtain the funds necessary to transfer the shuttle. A decision regarding this possibility is expected to be made in April.A NASA commentator describes Wednesday's landing as "the end of a historic journey. To a ship that has led the way, time and time again, we bid farewell to Discovery."Two remaining shuttle flights are scheduled later this year, {w|STS-134} and {w|STS-135}, before the retirement of the space shuttle fleet.== Sources ==

American {w|Bill Gates}, co-founder of Microsoft Corp, is again listed in second place with US$56 billion while investor {w|Warren Buffett} of {w|Berkshire Hathaway} is third.China added the most new  billionaires to the list with 54 while Russia added 31. The US came in third, with 23 new billionaires; American {w|Mark Zuckerberg}, chairman of Facebook, more than tripled his net worth to US$13.5 billion, placing him in Forbes' 52nd spot.  Although the US is home to 413 {w|Billionaire|billionaires}, more than any other country, the changing distribution of global finances is evident. Today, due to the increasing wealth of {w|Emerging nation|emerging nations}, just one in every three billionaires is American, a decline from ten years ago when Americans numbered one in every two. Brazil, Russia, India and China together accounted for more than 108 new billionaires. Last year, New York was home to more billionaires than any other city in the world, while this year Moscow is home to 79, which beats New York's current number of 58.

Yar Mohammad Khan, who was in his 60s was killed during a night raid in the {w|Dand district}. Khan, who also possibly used the surname of Karzai, was believed to have been a cousin of either the president or a cousin of the president's father.The president's brother, Ahmad Wali Karzai, released a statement over the shooting. He said, "It was a mistake. The forces conducted an operation, he was at his home, he came out and was shot. It was a mistake. What can you do about it?"

[[France first to recognise Libyan rebels as "legitimate representatives of the people"]]France  became the first country to formally recognize a newly formed Libyan  opposition council as the "legitimate representative of the Libyan people." The office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday it will send {w|ambassador|ambassadors} to the rebel stronghold in Benghazi, and in return the Libyan opposition council will  set up an {w|embassy} in Paris. The decision was made after President Sarkozy met with two representatives of the opposition group, the {w|National Transitional Council}, in Paris. Mustafa Gheriani, a representative for the Libyan opposition,  said he expected other EU members to follow Sarkozy's lead. Other EU members expressed uneasiness, and declined to meet with the two representatives. Although the EU has approved tighter sanctions in response to  Muammar Gaddafi's {w|Timeline of 2011 Libyan uprising|bloody crackdown on the opposition}, EU members  held back from endorsing a specific opposition group. Dutch Foreign Minister {w|Uri Rosenthal}, whose government still maintains an embassy in Tripoli,  cautioned, "There is not yet enough clarity about these opposition groups in and around Benghazi". {w|Catherine Ashton|Baroness Ashton}, spokesman for the EU foreign affairs chief, stated: "We cannot unilaterally rush into recognising groups." Other members expressed the need for the EU to speak in a unified voice.Contact between EU officials and opposition leaders is occurring. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said  he had spoken by telephone with {w|Mustafa Mohamed Abud Al Jeleil|Mahmoud Jabril}, special envoy of the Libyan Transitional National Council, before he left for NATO talks in {w|Brussels} on the Libyan situation. The talks planned to include a {w|Proposed Libyan no-fly zone|discussion of a no-fly zone over Libya}.Meanwhile,  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she plans to meet with  Libyan opposition members on her trip to Egypt and Tunisia next week.

[[IPad 2 goes on sale in United States]]The new version of Apple Inc.'s tablet computing device, the {w|iPad 2}, has gone on sale in the United States at Apple Stores and a number of other retailers, a shift from last year's launch which was only available through Apple's stores. The product will go on sale internationally on March 25.The device was announced on March 2 at an event at the {w|Yerba Buena Center for the Arts} in San Francisco, California. CEO Steve Jobs emerged from sick leave to make the announcement.The iPad 2 has an all-new design and has several improvements over the original iPad. The device runs on a dual-core {w|Apple A5} CPU. According to Jobs, the CPU's new dual-core capability enhances multitasking and doubles the processing speed. Apple additionally introduced a magnetic '{w|Smart Cover}' accessory that snaps to the front screen of the device along with several new apps ported from the {w|Mac OS X operating system} and the {w|iPhone}. These include {w|iMovie}, {w|GarageBand}, and {w|Photo Booth}. The new iPad introduces front and rear cameras which enable {w|FaceTime} and video. The new tablet is fifteen percent lighter and 33 percent thinner than the previous version¡ªthinner than an {w|iPhone 4}¡ªand has beveled edges. It is available in black and white and continues to be capable of ten hours of battery life on a single charge.The announcement came after months of rumors about the successor to the original iPad. Competitors have designed tablets to compete with the iPad, such as Motorola's {w|Motorola Xoom|Xoom} powered by the {w|Android|Android} operating system. Apple, who normally follows a yearly product cycle, has pressed its iPad successor into the marketplace almost a full month earlier than usual.Tablet computers have existed for years but, until recently, have not been popular amongst consumers. Tablet sales totaled 90,000 in 2009. Apple sold nearly fifteen million iPads worldwide in 2010, generating US$2 billion in revenue within three months. In 2010, Apple held a 75% share of the tablet computer market. According to one analyst, even with competition, iPads will still make up at least 20 million of the more than 24 million tablet computers sold in the United States in 2011. An analyst predicted 'conservatively' that 35 million iPad 2s will be sold in 2011. One analyst credits Apple's enormous {w|App Store} for the iPad's continued domination. Apple also holds an advantage in price over other tablets, many of which are still first generation devices. An analyst at J.P. Morgan predicts an overabundance of tablets caused by faltering demand. This could have drastic effects on competitors.The iPad connects to the Internet over {w|Wi-Fi} and 3G models of the new device can connect to the wireless networks of {w|AT&T} or {w|Verizon Wireless}. The iPad 2 will start at {w|US$}499¡ªthe same starting price of the original iPad. The equivalent model of the original iPad has been reduced to US$399.

[[8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, causes tsunami]]A massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern Japan early on Friday.  The earthquake's epicenter is 130 km east of {w|Sendai}, in the {w|Honshu} island of Japan. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was at a depth of 24.4 km.The earthquake triggered tsunamis in various parts of the country. Japan issued a tsunami warning immediately after the earthquake, followed by tsunami warnings for New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Chile, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, {w|Northern Marianas}, Taiwan, and California. It is confirmed for the Philippines that if the tsunami doesn't hit the country for 2 hours it will be slightly safer, it is currently alert number two for all regions.The tsunami attained a height of 10 meters, and swept houses, buildings and cars according to reports. {w|Shinkansen} stopped the bullet train service following the quake. According to reports, an oil refinery was set ablaze by the quake at {w|Ichihara, Chiba} prefecture to the east of Tokyo.The National Weather Service said that earthquakes "of this size" often "generate tsunamis potentially dangerous to coasts outside the source region." "Based on all available data a tsunami may have been generated by this earthquake that could be destructive on coastal areas even far from the epicenter," it added.About 20 people were reportedly injured in Tokyo following the collapse of a roof of a hall. 4 million people are estimated to be without power in the capital. In Sendai, several people are feared to be buried under the remains of a collapsed hotel.Prime Minister {w|Naoto Kan} said there had been no nuclear plant radiation leaks caused by the disaster. He expressed sympathy to all victims in his address, promising help, and stating that an emergency response headquarters had been set up. 288 people have been confirmed dead so far.However, a 2-3 km area around the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant has been evacuated as a precaution as the temperature inside on of the nuclear reactor has "remain[ed] at a high temperature" despite the plant being shut down. Trade Minister Banri Kaieda advised that there is a possibility of a radiation leak at the plant. == Sources == 
[[British MP reveals Fred Goodwin superinjunction]]John Hemming's revealing of the superinjunction in Parliament is protected by {w|Parliamentary privilege}. The revelation of the superinjunction came as a question during 'Business of the House' hearings:In a secret hearing, Fred Goodwin has obtained a super-injunction preventing him from being identified as a banker. Will the Government hold a debate, or make a statement, on freedom of speech, and whether there is one law for the rich, such as Fred Goodwin, and another for the poor, such as Lee Gilliland who has had his mental capacity removed on the basis of a report from his GP that he is not allowed to see?Superinjunctions have become a more frequently applied and often controversial practice in British law: they allow for parties to block publication of some controversial matter and also block publication of the fact that such an injunction has been granted. They came to light dramatically when a superinjunction was granted preventing {w|The Guardian} newspaper from revealing that statements regarding an allegation against the  commodities trading company {w|Trafigura} had been made in Parliament. The superinjunction was broken when a variety of bloggers and Twitter users started pointing to foreign news outlets that had published the allegations and the order against The Guardian. Superinjunctions have also been used by the Premiership football player {w|John Terry} following allegations of an affair.== Sources ==

[[U.S. February budget deficit is largest on record]]The U.S. {w|United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department} reported  the government posted  a monthly  {w|Deficit|budget deficit} of {w|United States dollar|US$}222.5 billion in February, the largest monthly deficit ever recorded. The February deficit, announced on Thursday, outstripped the February {w|Tax revenue|revenue gain} of $110 billion. The report comes at a time when the {w|White House} and both national political parties  are under extreme pressure to reduce the deficit as well as the total {w|Government debt|U.S. debt}. There is no agreement on how to reduce spending and increase government revenue, and both {w|Democratic Party|Democratic} and {w|Republican Party|Republican} measures have been voted down.Factors contributing to the February 2011 deficit compared to that of February 2010 included a 69% reduction in {w|Corporate tax in the United States|corporate tax receipts}, and an increase of  29% in  {w|interest} payments due on the U.S. debt. The government also spent more than in the previous February on {w|Entitlement|entitlement programs}, including an increase of 11% on {w|Medicare}. Government measures, such as an extension of  {w|Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance benefits}, cuts in the {w|payroll tax} and some  business tax reductions also contributed to the deficit.The White House has predicted that the U.S. budget deficit will reach $1.6 trillion this year and then fall to $1.1 trillion in 2012. {w|United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary}, {w|Timothy Geithner},  has warned  that by April 15 of this year, the U.S. is likely to reach its $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.== Sources == 
[[English policeman Nicholas Stone cleared of rape, facing jail for misconduct]]A court in England yesterday cleared a serving police officer of rape. However, Police Constable Nicholas Stone was told by the trial judge he faces jail for  having sex with the woman ¡ª for which he has been found guilty of {w|misconduct in a public office}.Stone was being tried for events from 1999 to 2001, when he worked for {w|Devon and Cornwall Police}. He met the woman involved following an arrest of a relative of hers. The prosecution had alleged he had sex with her on duty, and that this represented misconduct. He faced three misconduct charges, but was cleared of the other two by a jury at Exeter {w|Crown Court}.The prosecution case continued that the woman ended the relationship after discovering Stone was married. It was claimed he raped her in 2001 and that this resulted in a pregnancy that she miscarried. Stone had rejected every one of these claims; he accepted he had sex with the woman but not that it was ever on-duty or non-consensual. His wife supported him as he was prosecuted.Edward Burgess, defending, had suggested to the jury anger at Stone's lack of support for the woman following the miscarriage motivated the woman to lie about being raped. He told the jury their feelings about Stone's unfaithfulness towards his wife should not influence their decisions. Judge Graham Cottle had given similar instructions as he sent them out to begin deliberations on Thursday: "What is required of you is a dispassionate assessment of the evidence."Stone's present employers are {w|Avon and Somerset Police}, who have suspended him since last June. Cottle has commented that the woman was "extremely vulnerable" and in having sex with her Stone, of {w|Taunton}, took advantage of his job and could expect a prison sentence. Avon and Somerset Police commented after conviction that "[t]he community can find confidence in the fact that police do police themselves."== Sources == 
[[Honey bee decline spreading globally]]Scientists working for the United Nations {w|United Nations Environment Programme|Environment Programme} reported Thursday that the collapse of {w|Western honey bee|honey bee} colonies is becoming a world wide phenomenon and will continue unless humans work to restore habitats for bees. The insects are necessary for {w|Pollination|pollinating} crops and the report calls for profound changes in how humans {w|Planetary management|manage the planet}.The decline in managed bee colonies, first noticed in Europe and the U.S., is now seen in China and Japan, and there are signs of {w|Colony collapse disorder|colony collapses} in Egypt. According to the {w|United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture}, honey-producing colonies in the U.S. have declined from 5.5 million colonies in 1950 to 2.5 million in 2007. A co-author of the report, Peter Neumann, said changes in rural areas during the past 50 years have contributed to decline of wild bees and other {w|Pollinator|pollinators}. Additional factors include the declines in flowering plants, the use of harmful chemicals and insecticides, the increase in air pollution and a worldwide trade system that spreads bee {w|Pathogen|pathogens} and pests. The world's growing {w|World population|population} means more bees are needed to pollinate the crops to feed more people. According to the U.N. report, of the 100 crop species that supply 90 percent of the world's food, bees pollinate more than 70 percent. Noting that humans seem to believe that they can operate independent of nature through technological innovations, Achim Steiner, the executive director of the UNEP said, "Bees underline the reality that we are more, not less dependent on {w|Ecosystem services|nature's services} in a world of close to 7 billion people." The report calls for such measures as incentives for farmers and land owners to encourage them to restore habitats that are friendly to pollinators. == Sources == 
[[Explosion at earthquake-damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant]]An explosion has been reported at Japan's stricken {w|Fukushima Daiichi} nuclear power plant after its cooling system was damaged by a massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake that hit off the North-East coast of Japan on Friday. The explosion occurred at around 3:00pm local time. According to the plant's operator, {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company}, four workers were injured in the explosion.The explosion occurred as workers were attempting to cool a reactor by injecting water into its core. Local media are reporting that the plant's exterior walls have been destroyed and only a skeleton structure remains.More than 45,000 residents within a 10-kilometre radius of the plant have been evacuated.Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant. Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors, turn off air-conditioners and not to drink tap water. According to Japan's nuclear agency, radioactive {w|caesium} and {w|iodine} has been identified at the plant. Authorities speculate that this indicates that containers holding uranium fuel at the site may have ruptured and are leaking.
[[Special report on Japanese tsunami emergency in Pichilemu, Chile]]On Friday, a strong earthquake in Japan triggered a massive tsunami throughout the Pacific Ocean. Chilean President Sebasti¨¢n Pi?era declared a "preventive tsunami warning" that morning. "I want to express my, and Chilean people's solidarity with the Japanese government and people, who were hit by one of the worse earthquakes and tsunamis in the history of mankind," Pi?era said. Later that day, the tsunami first reached Chilean territory in {w|Easter Island}, without causing any damage.Schools executed the {w|Francisca Cooper Integral Evacuation and School Safety Plan}, a preventive emergency operation against earthquakes, fires, and other emergencies, during Friday morning. The operation, officially called "Cooper Plan", is named after Francisca Cooper, killed in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami.During the afternoon, people living or owning stores, restaurants, and kiosks near the beach began to take their belongings away, due to the potential damage the tsunami would cause. Police officers did not allow cars to pass by the nearest street to the beach, the Costanera Avenue, especially in the {w|Cardenal Caro Province} Government area; however, curious people traveling on foot were able to see the strong waves hitting the Pichilemu shoreline before the eventual tsunami. The {w|Agust¨ªn Ross Balcony} was used mostly for that purpose, until {w|Investigations Police of Chile} told people to leave the area because "it was dangerous."At around 16:30 local time, the Intendant of O'Higgins Region, Rodrigo P¨¦rez Mackenna, arrived at Pichilemu Municipal Stadium in a helicopter, to inform Mayor Roberto C¨®rdova of what he and other authorities should do because of the emergency, according to reports.Fishermen took their boats away from the beach. "I don't want to lose it [the boat] again, we were already very affected by the February 27 earthquake and I just don't want that to happen again; we still have time," a fisherman, Manuel Gonz¨¢lez said.At around 21:30 local time, heavy rain began to fall in the city. Most of the people who evacuated to the {w|La Cruz Hill} quickly went back to their houses, despite most of them being too close to the beach to be safe. Some of them preferred to stay in refuges provided by the {w|Pichilemu city hall|municipality of Pichilemu}: the Pichilemu Municipal Gymnasium, and the Pueblo de Viudas Primary School. Fabricio C¨¢ceres said on {w|Canal 3 Pichilemu} that "people should stay calm," and that the tsunami "would not be any worse than February 27's." Personnel of the {w|Pichilemu Police}, the Pichilemu Fire Bureau, and {w|Investigations Police of Chile} kept on patrolling the city's streets.The Pichilemu Hospital, located around 100 meters from the beach, was moved temporarily to the {w|Agust¨ªn Ross Edwards High School} facilities.The tsunami waves finally hit Pichilemu at around 03:30 local time on Saturday, damaging some kiosks that were too close to the beach. In Playa Hermosa, around three kilometers south of the center of the city, the tsunami even reached houses and {w|caba?as}, but caused no damage. Some reports on Radio Entre Olas say that the tsunami reached up to 70 meters inland. According to {w|Hern¨¢n de Solminihac}, {w|Ministry of Public Works|Minister of Public Works}, Pichilemu's Caleta de Pescadores suffered minor damage.The tsunami warning was lifted in most of Chilean territory but "{w|Arica}, {w|Iquique}, {w|Antofagasta|Antofag¨¹asta} [sic], {w|Caldera, Chile|Caldera}, {w|Constituci¨®n, Chile|Constituci¨®n}, {w|Talcahuano}, and {w|Lebu, Chile|Lebu}," by Sebasti¨¢n Pi?era at 10:45 local time on Saturday.Governor of Cardenal Caro {w|Julio Ibarra} said that "around 10,000 people were evacuated in Pichilemu to {w|Pueblo de Viudas} or {w|La Cruz Hill}," and that the tsunami was "just meters away from affecting the [Cardenal Caro] province government building."

According to League officials, the group had been in contact with rebels engaged in fighting prior to the meeting.According to {w|Amr Moussa}, the organization's secretary general, it had "officially requested the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone against any military action against the Libyan people." Moussa went on to say that he was "talking about a humanitarian action ... supporting the Libyan people in their fight for freedom against a regime that is more and more disdainful."According to onlookers, some members of the League, including Saudi Arabia and Algeria, are concerned about establishing a no-fly zone because they have experienced protests as well, and they worry that uprisings similar to the Libyan one could occur. Additionally, even though the League voted in favor of a no-fly zone, other analysts say internal dissent could lead to them going no further than stating their support.During the meeting, Libyan protesters gathered outside the headquarters building in support of a no-fly zone. One protester, originally from the Libyan city of Benghazi, said that "[w]e want the Arab League to show the same resolve on this situation as the rest of the world...if they don't, it will be embarrassing for them in front of their own peoples and everyone else."NATO considers the support of regional powers essential if a no-fly zone is to be established, as some members believe that it could be seen as outside interference by Western powers. According to Britain's Foreign Secretary, {w|William Hague}, "You need support within the region from the Arab world" for a no-fly zone and "[the UK] would like Arab nations to participate in it militarily."
[[Death toll rises from Japan quake]]The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on Friday has risen to more than a thousand, with many people still missing, according to reports issued over the weekend.While Japan's police says that only 637 are confirmed dead, media reports say that over a thousand people have been killed, with several hundred bodies still being transported. Thousands more are still unaccounted for; in the town of {w|Minamisanriku, Miyagi|Minamisanriku}, {w|Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi Prefecture} alone, up to 10,000 people are missing. Four trains that were on the coast have yet to be located.In the aftermath of the disaster, evacuations of around 300,000 people have taken place; more evacuations are likely in the wake of concerns over a damaged nuclear power plant. According to Prime Minister {w|Naoto Kan}, around 3,000 people have been rescued thus far. 50,000 troops from the Japanese military have been deployed to assist in rescue efforts.The tsunami generated by the quake has destroyed communities along Japan's Pacific coast, with up to 90% of the houses in some towns having been destroyed; at least 3,400 structures have been destroyed in total. Fires have also sprung up among the impacted areas.
[[Cuba sentences USAID worker to fifteen-year prison term]]A 15-year prison sentence was handed down by a Cuban court to US Agency for International Development worker Alan Gross for crimes against the state.Gross was arrested in December 2009 while on a {w|USAID} mission intended to promote democracy by distributing satellite communications equipment to Jewish groups; these groups have denied any involvement in the matter. Such equipment, and distributing it, is illegal in Cuba.According to a Cuban court, Gross's activities were part of "a subversive project of the US government that aimed to destroy the Revolution through the use of communications systems out of the control of authorities."In response to the decision, a {w|United States National Security Council|US National Security Council} spokesperson said that the "sentencing adds another injustice to Alan Gross¡¯s ordeal. He has already spent too many days in detention and should not spend one more."Gross's wife has requested that Cuba release her husband on humanitarian grounds; some political analysts expect this to eventually occur. Gross, aged 61, is reported to have lost 90 pounds while imprisoned since his arrest, and is affected by {w|Ulcer|ulcers}, {w|gout}, and {w|arthritis}.== Sources == 
[[Four dead after Yemen police fire on protesters]]Police forces in Yemen opened fire on protesters with gunfire, tear gas and water cannons Saturday morning, killing four people in two separate events.The incidents began overnight, after the largest protests yet on Friday drew some 100,000 people. Before dawn, security troops attacked protesters in the capitol city of {w|Sana'a}; several hours earlier they had surrounded a central square where protestors were located. At around five in the morning local time, security forces began firing on the protesters, using first water cannons, and shortly thereafter tear gas and live ammunition. Witnesses said the attack began shortly after morning prayers.Three people were killed in Sana'a, while a teenage boy was also killed in {w|Al Mukalla|Mukalla}. The scene in Sana'a was described by one protester as "total mayhem [...] a real battlefield."In response to the deaths, the US embassy in Sana'a issued a report saying that the Yemeni government should investigate the events, and denied claims that the US government "has somehow condoned the use of violence by any side." US counterterrorism official {w|John O. Brennan} said that both the opposition and government "should respond constructively to President Saleh's call to engage in a serious dialogue to end the current impasse."Yemeni president {w|Ali Abdullah Saleh} had previously said the government would not use violence against protesters, and according to O'Brennan had "reiterated his hope that the opposition will engage immediately in a dialogue with the government as well as his public assurance not to use violence against peaceful demonstrators" in the wake of the deaths on Saturday.== Sources == 
[[Cuba releases leading dissident from prison]]The Cuban government released  one of the country's  leading dissidents, {w|?scar El¨ªas Biscet}. from prison on Friday, under an agreement attained through talks supported by Spain and reached last July  between Cuba's president {w|Raul Castro} and Cuba's {w|Catholic Church} to free 52 political prisoners.   Biscet, 49, was sentenced to a 25-year prison term   in 2003 for "acts against the sovereignty and independence of the national territory".The original  deadline for the release was November 7, and the 40 who were released by that date agreed  to exile in Spain. Biscet and 11 others   refused to leave Cuba and were not freed by the deadline. Biscet stated, "I¡¯ve always lived in Cuba and I¡¯m from Cuba. I haven¡¯t done anything bad to anyone. I¡¯ve always given love, a lot of love, and for giving love they came down hard on me, especially the government".A follower of the peacefully resistant philosophies of   {w|Gandhi} and {w|Martin Luther King},  Biscet's nonviolent  fight for human rights and his persistent opposition to the  Cuban government have won him worldwide prominence. He has worked to oppose {w|abortion} and the {w|death penalty} and campaigned to free  Cuban political prisoners. In 2007 {w|George W. Bush|President George W. Bush} bestowed upon him the {w|Presidential Medal of Freedom|Medal of Freedom}, American's highest civilian honor,  in recognition of his work.Biscet was escorted by security agents to his home in {w|Havana|Havana}. He told  reports gathered there, "It goes without saying that I will continue in the opposition because even in jail I did not give up my questioning attitude toward this government and the abuses it commits."  == Sources == 
[[New York tour bus crash kills 14]]At least fourteen people have died after a chartered bus crashed in {w|The Bronx}, New York. According to authorities, the tour bus accident also injured eighteen other people, amongst which five were critically injured.The vehicle was travelling from {w|Mohegan Sun} in Connecticut to the village of {w|Oxoboxo River|Uncasville}, also located in Connecticut. When the crash occurred on {w|Interstate 95} at approximately 0535 {w|Eastern Time Zone|EST} on Sunday, there were at least thirty-one passengers present.40-year-old Ophadell Williams, the driver of the bus, reported to the police that the vehicle came into contact with a {w|Semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer truck}, which was veering across the interstate. He said that he attempted to move out of the way of this vehicle, causing the bus itself to swerve, overturn and scrape the side of a railing for one hundred yards before impacting with a highway sign's upholding bar.Captain James Ellson, of the fire service, described the scene as "a pile of humans, either still in their seats or on the floor, wrapped in the metal". Jose Hernandez, one of the survivors of the bus crash, said that "[w]e tried to help people, but there was twisted metal in the way".The semi-trailer truck driver failed to stop after the accident. Police are currently attempting to detect this driver. {w|Raymond Kelly}, the current {w|New York City Police Commissioner}, stated that the truck was moving on a lane to the bus' nearside, although whether the vehicles came into contact with each other or not is yet to be confirmed. Both vehicles were travelling at "a significant rate of speed", according to Kelly.
[[Japan facing 'most severe crisis since World War II', says prime minister]]Amongst the aftermath of a magnitude 8.9 earthquake which struck on Friday, followed by a tsunami, {w|Naoto Kan}, the {w|Prime minister|prime minister} of Japan,  claimed that the country is experiencing its largest difficulties since the end of World War II in 1945. {QuoteLeft|The current situation of the earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear plants is in a way the most severe crisis in the past 65 years since World War II|source={{w|Naoto Kan}, {w|Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese prime minister}}}"The current situation of the earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear plants is in a way the most severe crisis in the past 65 years since World War II," Kan said. Speaking on television, he stated that "[w]hether we Japanese can overcome this crisis depends on each of us. I strongly believe that we can get over this great earthquake and tsunami by joining together."Kan reported that there were limited supplies of electricity due to the closure of numerous {w|Power station|power stations}, including {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant|a nuclear power plant} located in {w|Fukushima Prefecture}. According to {w|NHK}, a broadcasting organization in Japan, approximately 310,000 individuals have been transported to safety in shelters that, in various cases, do not contain electricity.The {w|Government of Japan} has reported the deaths of one thousand individuals, although thousands of others have not been taken into account. The police have claimed that the death toll in {w|Miyagi Prefecture|the Miyagi Prefecture} as a result of the earthquake and tsunami could be in excess of ten thousand. 100,000 troops - which equates to approximately 40% of the country's armed forces - are said to have been committed to assisting with the survivors of the disasters.The nuclear agency of Japan consider the circumstances at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant to be Level 4 on the {w|International Nuclear Event Scale}, which is {w|International Nuclear Event Scale#INES Level 4: Accident with local consequences|an accident with local consequences}. According to {w|BBC News Online}, incidents like this usually cause one person to die from causes related to radiation. No individuals from the power plant are reported to have died.
[[Israel to build new settlements in West Bank]]Israel announced Sunday that it plans to build several hundred new housing facilities in the occupied {w|West Bank}, days after several Israelis were {w|Itamar attack|killed} in an attack on Friday.According to officials, a meeting on Saturday of a government committee resulted in the decision to build up to 500 new housing units, all within existing settlements.  The new buildings are to be constructed in areas that Israel expects to retain control of in the event of any potential peace accord with Palestine.A Palestinian spokesperson said that Israel's decision was "wrong and unacceptable and will only create problems." The building of settlements by Israel is widely criticized; in February fourteen of the fifteen United Nations Security Council members, with the US the only exception, supported a resolution that would demand Israel stop further construction.The announcement of the new buildings came days after five Israelis were stabbed to death on Friday night, in an attack suspected to be of Palestinian origin. In response to the attack, residents of the area had asked the Israeli government to build new housing facilities. The attacks were referenced by Prime Minister {w|Benjamin Netanyahu}, who said in a statement that he had "noticed that several countries that always hasten to the U.N. Security Council in order to condemn Israel, the state of the Jews, for planning a house in some locality, or for laying some tiles somewhere, have been dilatory in sharply condemning the murder of Jewish infants."== Sources == 
[[Researchers identify genetic link to peanut allergies]]An international research team at {w|Dundee University} in Scotland has established a gene called {w|Filaggrin} is linked to peanut allergies. Calling the research a "potential breakthrough", the team says it is the first firm evidence of a genetic element to the potentially fatal condition.The team ¡ª including scientists from the Netherlands, the UK, Ireland, and Canada ¡ª had previously identified Filaggrin as linked to {w|eczema} and {W|asthma}. The gene is involved in ensuring the skin is an effective barrier to irritants and Dundee University fellow Dr. Sara Brown described "logical next step" as investigating peanut allergy linkage.The university says in the last two¨Cthree decades there has been a major rise in peanut allergies, which now affect 1¨C2% of young Britons. The condition is not fully understood, but it is now known that changes in the structure of Filaggrin can cause a genetic fault, leading to increased liklihood of peanut allergy.The gene is a factor in around 20% of the cases studied, and Dundee's Professor Irwin McLean ¡ª a Filaggrin expert ¡ª said more work is required to fully understand the causes of the disease. "We knew that people with a Filaggrin defect were likely to suffer from eczema, and that many of those people also had peanut allergy," he explained. "What we have now shown is that the Filaggrin defect is there for people who have peanut allergy but who don't have eczema, which shows a clear link between Filaggrin and peanut allergy."== Sources == 
[[Al Jazeera cameraman killed in eastern Libya]]An Al Jazeera cameraman working in Libya  was killed in an alleged ambush  on Saturday  as he was returning with his team to the rebel-held city of Benghazi. Al Jazeera, in an official statement, called the act a "cowardly crime" and  "part of the Libyan regime's malicious campaign targeting Al Jazeera and its staff".The director general of Al Jazeera Wadah Khanfar paid tribute to Jaber at the network's media forum. He said,  "He was one of those people who lived and eventually died in the pursuit of truth. We are determined to carry on regardless. We cannot sacrifice our lives except for noble causes. There is no nobler cause than the pursuit of truth."Al Jaber, a Qatari national, is the first journalist reported  to have been killed in the Libyan conflict. Reporters who were previously welcomed  by opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi now feel threatened by Gaddafi supporters as his forces near Benghazi. There are signs that Gaddafi intends to drive the foreign press out of Libya. He has already announced that foreign reporters working in the east of the country are working for "Al-Qaeda." Many journalists are now planning to leave the city.The director of Al Jazeera, Wadah Khanfar, said that the killing of the cameraman followed "an unprecedented campaign" against  the news organization by Gaddafi. He said, "Al Jazeera reiterates the assault cannot dent its resolve to continue its mission, professionally enlightening the public of the unfolding events in Libya and elsewhere." He described the  people in  Benghazi who expressed support of the station once news of the ambush was reported. 
[[US State department official resigns after Wikileaks comments]]A spokesperson for the US state department, {w|Philip J. Crowley|Philip Crowley}, resigned today after making comments describing the treatment of {w|Bradley Manning}, who is accused of leaking information to Wikileaks, as "stupid."Crowley made the comments last week at the {w|Massachusetts Institute of Technology}. After being asked a question about concerns Manning was being tortured while in prison, Crowley replied that he thought that how the Defense Department was treating Manning was "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid." He also said that he still believed Manning belonged in prison.Crowley's remarks sparked widespread controversy, and on Friday President Barack Obama was asked about them at a press conference. In reply, Obama said that Defense Department officials had "assure[d] me" that Manning was being treated appropriately.In a statement, Crowley said that "[g]iven the impact of my remarks, for which I take full responsibility, I have submitted my resignation." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that Mike Hammer, a current White House aide, will replace Crowley.  She also said that it was "with regret" that she accepted his resignation, and wished him "the very best."
[[Japanese tsunami impacts California coastal town]]The tsunami caused by Japan's magnitude 8.9 quake on Friday destroyed the {w|commercial fishing} harbor of {w|Crescent City, California|Crescent City}, California, a coastal  town still recovering from a devastating {w|1964 Alaska earthquake|tsunami in 1964}. Although most of the fishing boats were removed in advance, the 198 docking slips that the harbor had provided   for boats, enabling the livelihoods of the  fishing crews, were lost. Crescent City's unemployment rate was 13 percent before Friday's tsunami destroyed its commerical fishing industry.  The 1964 tsunami that hit Crescent City killed 11, demolished the harbor and heavily damaged large portions of the business district. Although the city subsequently rebuilt, {w|2006 Kuril Islands earthquake|another tsunami again damaged the harbor in 2006}. The city was in the midst of reconstructing the harbor when Friday's tsunami hit. The harbor is surrounded by land and a {w|Breakwater|breakwater} built after the 1964 disaster. The tsunami's huge waves entered  through a small opening provided for the entrance and exit of boats. Lori Dengler, director of the Humboldt Earthquake Education Center, says Friday's tsunami was one of as many as 38 tsunamis to strike Crescent City within the last 78 years. She calls the city a "tsunami magnet"  because of the {w|topography} of the ocean floor that contributes to its vulnerability.  She also blames the breakwater built after the 1964 tsunami because it traps  tsunami waves in the harbor, causing them to boil and churn. A county supervisor found the view painful on Saturday as she surveyed the wreckage  accompanied by state officials. She is hoping they will provide   emergency assistance. "We don't have the financial resources," she said. "We need money. That's what it takes to fix things¡­. Our poor little harbor."== Sources == 
[[Domestic economic impacts likely after Japanese earthquake]]According to analysts, the major earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit on Friday is likely to have major economic impacts within Japan, though the global economy is unlikely to be significantly affected.The overall negative impact of the earthquake on Japan's {w|gross domestic product} is expected to be only a few tenths of one percent, though that is expected to be enough to push Japan's expected recovery from its current economic slump back by several months.  According to the {w|Nomura Group}, "[w]e had projected an April-June exit [from the slump]  but now forecast July-September or possibly October-December." It added that most of the economic effects of the quake will probably be felt early this summer.To fund the current rescue efforts, the Japanese government is reportedly considering raising taxes, as the estimated cost of rebuilding affected areas is as high as one percent of the total five trillion {w|US dollar|dollar} GDP. Japan currently carries high levels of debt, estimated to be about ten trillion dollars, which is expected to make additional government spending for rebuilding efforts difficult.The Japanese stock market index {w|Nikkei 225} dropped 1.7% at the end of the day Friday; it closed fourteen minutes after the quake and tsunami struck. Beginning on Monday, when trading resumes, the {w|Bank of Japan} is, according to its governor, prepared to inject money into the economy in order to stabilize the markets.
[[Japan earthquake shifts Earth's axis 10 centimetres]]According to the Italian-based National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the magnitude 8.9 earthquake that struck Japan on Friday caused the axis of the planet {w|Earth} to shift by approximately ten centimetres. Experts believe that this has [shifted] the axis of rotation of the Earth [further] than the 2004 earthquake in Sumatra.According to La Naci¨®n, the impact of the Japanese earthquake caused an energy release one hundred times larger than that of the earthquake which struck Haiti in 2010. Leading the research at the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, Antonio Piersanti stated that [o]ur estimate is not derived from direct measurements, which require much more time, but theoretical calculations.Richard Gross, of NASA's {w|Jet Propulsion Laboratory}, was responsible for discovering the extent to which the Earth's axis had been shifted by the 2010 Chile earthquake. He claimed that there should be no impact [from] this change in rotation on daily life.Gross explained: Although we have not evaluated the measurements of the Earth's rotation, my calculations indicate that the change in the distribution of land masses caused by the Japanese earthquake may have caused the Earth to rotate a little faster, shortening the length of day about 1.6 microseconds. He said that despite the fact that [t]his change in the position of the axis of rotation will cause the Earth to wobble a bit different[ly] as it rotates, the planet's axis would not alter in space.

"It doesn't make Burger King an attractive employer for women," she added.Hees joined Burger King in October of last year. He oversees the company's 11,500 stores worldwide.
[[Libyan government forces capture eastern town from rebels]]Libyan government troops have captured the seaport of {w|Marsa Brega Seaport|Brega} as they continue to move east through the country.Over the past several days, government troops have captured several previously rebel-held areas, including the town of {w|Ra's Lanuf} on Saturday. In Sunday's events, government forces reportedly used air strikes and shelling against rebel forces, who retreated in the direction of Benghazi, with government forces in pursuit.A Libyan military source said on state television that "Brega has been cleansed of armed gangs." A rebel involved in the fighting in Brega said that "There¡¯s no uprising any more. The other day we were in Ras Lanuf, then Brega, the day after tomorrow they will be in Benghazi."As government forces move east, morale among rebel forces is claimed to be low by the government. A military spokesperson said that rebels "are people who when we come to them raise their hands and give up."Internationally, calls for a no-fly zone over Libya are increasing. The Arab League voted on Saturday for a no-fly zone, while France has said it will increase its efforts to persuade the international community put one in place.

[[British pathologist criticised by General Medical Council]]Dr Freddy Patel, a former British Home Office pathologist, has been criticised by a panel at the {w|General Medical Council}, Britain's regulatory body for doctors. Dr Patel had concluded that the death of Sally White in 2002, the first victim of {w|Anthony Hardy}, could have been from natural causes.The report produced by Dr Patel concluded that Sally White had been having consensual sex in her apartment when she died of a heart attack, in spite of blood stains on her clothing, blood at the scene, damage to Ms White's liver and bite marks. The GMC panel found that Dr Patel had included inaccurate information on his CV and had shown "deficient professional performance" in the evaluation of the cause of Sally White's death. They concluded that this investigation was "irresponsible, not of the standard expected of a competent forensic pathologist and liable to bring the medical profession into disrepute". Dr Patel is currently suspended and the decision of the panel may lead to him being struck off.The GMC had previously investigated Dr Patel and criticised his investigation of the {w|death of Ian Tomlinson}, a newspaper seller who died during the G20 protests in London. He concluded that the death was caused by coronary heart disease; subsequent investigations by other pathologists showed that he had died from internal bleeding caused by a blunt force trauma ¡ª an assault by a police officer caught on video. The Director of Public Prosecution noted afterwards that the mistakes in the forensic pathology report by Dr Patel had made it significantly harder to bring the police officer who fatally assaulted Ian Tomlinson to justice. Dr Patel has also been investigated by the GMC for alleged misconduct in the investigation of the deaths of two children.== Sources == 
[[Japan earthquake death toll estimated at over 10,000]]The official death toll from the devastating Japanese earthquake that hit on Friday is now nearing 1,900, while police officials say that it is all but certain the final toll will be at least 10,000 people dead.Bodies are still being recovered¡ª2,000 thus far in the {w|Miyagi Prefecture} alone.  The official count of those missing has now reached 2,300, though in one town alone, an estimated half of the 17,000 person population is still unaccounted for.  Approximately 350,000 people have been left without homes; shelters are providing housing for the moment.Due to infrastructure damage, survivors in the hard-hit northeast coast of Japan are coping with limited resources, including food, water and electricity. In the {w|Iwate Prefecture}, a government official stated that the incoming goods from relief efforts are only about ten percent of what is necessary.At the {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant}, a second explosion occurred on Monday at the building housing Reactor 3, following an explosion Saturday at the Reactor 1 building.

[[Middle Eastern troops enter Bahrain after protests]]Troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have arrived in Bahrain at the government's request after major protests on Sunday.An estimated 1,000 Saudi Arabian troops entered the country early Monday, followed by around 500 troops from the UAE. The troops entered as part of a broader deployment by the {w|Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf}, a regional group of six countries.  It is unclear what purpose the troops are serving, though speculation is that they will guard major infrastructure facilities.  Statements from the US government, a major Bahrain ally, said that "[t]his is not an invasion of a country" and that it urged both the Bahrain government and the GCC "to exercise restraint" and "act in a way that supports dialogue instead of undermining it."An official of Iranian Foreign Ministry also criticized the Saudi invasion of Bahrain, saying "it is surprising to see that immediately after the recent trip of the US Defense Secretary [Robert Gates] we see the intensified use of violence against the people of Bahrain."The intervention came a day after the country saw the worst protests since February, as several dozen people were injured in clashes with police.== Sources == 
[[Third explosion at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant]]An explosion was reported at 0610 local time Tuesday morning at the {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant}'s second reactor. The blast is feared to have breached the pressure chamber.The explosion is thought to have been in the reactor's "pressure suppression room" ¡ª part of the cooling system. It damaged the area that contains water to cool the reactor, but it is not yet clear whether it affected the containment structure near the core.Government officials have said that there was limited damage as a result of the explosion, and efforts to cool the reactor would go on, but nuclear industry executives in Japan have said that the situation is far worse, and other unnamed officials said the containment structure had been damaged, but did not say to what extent. In the wake of the explosion, officials at the {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company}, the plant's operator, said for the first time a partial meltdown could be taking place within the reactor.After the explosion, radiation levels near the facility rose from 1,941 to 8,712 {w|Sievert|microsieverts}, a level still short of that required to cause immediate health effects, and radiation decreased again some time after the explosion. The legal limit for radiation in one year is a thousand microseiverts, but radiation sickness does not occur until a million microseiverts.Prior to the explosion the fuel rods in the reactor reported to again be exposed after the pressure valve closed at 11pm local time, preventing pumping in cooling water."The reactor containment vessel, which is the last line of defence to contain the radiation, this may have experienced some damage...it seems that there are damages at several different places of these walls around radioactive substances." [excerpted from live translation transcription by CNN of NHK coverage of press conference, stream]According to TEPCO, all but 50 employees of the plant were evacuated after the incident.Workers at the 40-year old plant have been struggling to deal with the aftermath of Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami. On Saturday, a hydrogen explosion occurred at the number one reactor, followed by a second explosion on Sunday to the number three reactor. The number two reactor was reported to be overheating, with exposed fuel rods, earlier today. Nearly 185,000 people have been evacuated from the 20 km zone around the plant.
[[Dying Canadian infant moved to U.S. hospital for medical treatment]]A thirteen-month-old Canadian  infant dying from a unknown neurological condition was transferred Sunday night from a Canadian hospital, where he had received treatment since October 2010, to a U.S. hospital. In January, a Canadian Superior Court judge had ruled that the Canadian hospital could remove the infant's {w|Life support|breathing tube} against the parents' wishes and issued a {w|Do not resuscitate|do-not-resuscitate} order. According to court documents, Joseph Maraachli, known as "Baby Joseph", has been repeatedly diagnosed as in a {w|Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state} with no hope of recovery after suffering an episode of "{w|Epilepsy|seizure activity}" at age six months. At that time, an {w|MRI} showed "a reduction in brain size associated with cells dying from metabolic stress." He stopped breathing in October and was hospitalized at  {w|Ontario's London Health Sciences Centre|Ontario's London Health Sciences Centre} where he remained until Sunday. A panel of  five pediatric clinic and three neurology physicians subsequently concluded that "there will be no recovery and no treatment options exist for this progressive {w|Degenerative disease|neurodegenerative disorder}."The infant's parents, Moe Maraachli and Sana Nader, wanted Joseph to receive a {w|tracheotomy}, which combined with  mechanical breathing devices, would allow him to  be transferred home,  his family acting as care givers. Several years previously,  the Maraachli's  daughter had  died of a similar neuro-degenerative condition. They used their daughter, Zina, as an example. After doctors performed a tracheotomy on her, she returned home for several months before returning to die at the hospital.  This time  hospital refused to perform a tracheotomy on Joseph  because there was no hope of recovery. After the judge ruled in the hospital's favor in January, pressure against the hospital intensified and the hospital received threats.The case has generated  controversy primarily from groups such as the {w|Terri Schiavo case|Terri Schiavo organization}, {w|Priests for Life}, and the {w|American Center for Law & Justice} who represents the parents. The parents transferred the infant to the {w|Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital|Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center} in {w|St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis}, Missouri to obtain a second opinion. PFL nation director, {w|Father Pavone}, traveled to Canada Sunday night to aid in  the transfer.

The first fire caused a leak of concentrated radioactive material, according to the Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan.The first fire broke out at 9:40 a.m. local time on Tuesday, and was thought to have been put out, but another fire was discovered early on Wednesday, believed to have started because the earlier one had not been fully extinguished.In a televised statement, the prime minister told residents near the plant that "I sincerely ask all citizens within the 20 km distance from the reactor to leave this zone." He went on to say that "[t]he radiation level has risen substantially. The risk that radiation will leak from now on has risen."Kan warned residents to remain indoors and to shut windows and doors to avoid radiation poisoning.The French Embassy in Japan reports that the radiation will reach Tokyo in 10 hours, with current wind speeds.== Sources ==

[[Florida prisons ban inmate smoking]]Florida {w|Florida Department of Corrections|Department of Corrections} Secretary Edwin Buss  announced on Monday that Florida's prisons will become tobacco-free within six months in order to cut health-care costs and make prisons safer.  Buss stated that the cost to Florida taxpayers for  treating inmates for {w|Health effects of tobacco|tobacco-related illnesses} such as {w|cancer} and {w|emphysema} neared {w|United States dollar|US$}9 million last year alone.Inmates will be offered help in {w|Smoking cessation|quitting smoking}, possibly including the use of {w|Nicotine patch|nicotine patches}. Gretl Plessinger, Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said that the department is working with the {w|Prison commissary|prison canteen} vendors to make the patches available for purchase through the canteens. Last year inmates spent $19 million on {w|tobacco products}. Although the prison does make money from tobacco sales, Plessinger said, she noted that other states have not lost  revenue by banning tobacco.  "Inmates spend the money they have on other products like hard candy," she said.Plessinger said that banning smoking will also make prisons safer: "It will reduce the risk of {w|arson}. And lighters can be used to melt plastic objects like toothbrushes into shanks."Beginning on Sept. 30, cigarettes will be considered {w|contraband},  and prisoners caught smoking will face disciplinary proceedings with possible loss of privileges such as visitation rights and loss of gain time. U.S. Federal prisons already ban smoking as do  more than half of U.S. state prisons. Smoking is also prohibited in Florida's public buildings. For Florida prison employees, designated smoking areas will be provided outside the prison walls.== Sources ==

Internet Explorer is the most used web browser, responsible for 56% of webpage hits. The new version adds support for new technologies with relation to the {W|HTML5} specification and several feature changes. The browser was released as a beta with a campaign promoting the benefits of HTML5.It includes support for SVG and the HTML5 canvas, audio, and video tags. It has a failing Acid3 score of 95/100, below Mozilla Firefox 4.0's 97/100, rating and the 100/100 in Google Chrome 10. The program is the first of its series not to run on Microsoft {w|Windows XP}. It includes a redesigned layout of the address bar and the ability to pin sites to the taskbar on {w|Windows 7}, along with several minor improvements.The browser received mixed reviews. "IE9 as a Consumer Browser ¡ª Not Worth It," Jason Mick, {w|DailyTech}, concluded.

This figure, which was measured between October 2010 and January 2011, is the highest rate of unemployment the country has experienced since 1994. {QuoteLeft|Clearly any increase in unemployment is unwelcome and a disappointment and it underlines the need for a Budget next week which focuses on growth, on creating an environment where businesses are growing and developing and creating jobs.|source={{w|Chris Grayling}, {w|Minister of State} of {w|Department for Work and Pensions}}}The {w|Office for National Statistics|Office for National Statistics} stated that the percentage of those jobless was eight per cent, the peak for that rate since 1996. In the three months approaching February 2011, nearly five hundred thousand occupations were vacant, an increase of twenty-four thousand in comparison to the preceding three months.According to the ONS, the quantity of 16-24 year-old individuals without an occupation has increased by 0.8% to a record peak of 20.6%, including students who are seeking employment. British {w|Prime minister|Prime Minister} David Cameron described this number as "disappointing, once again".The executive office also commented that, in February 2011, 10,200 fewer people were requesting {w|Jobseeker's Allowance}, causing the total amount to decrease to 1.45 million people. 25,000 more people aged 50-64 now have an occupation, causing the amount of those employed in that age demographic to rise to a record 7.3 million. Cameron has described this situation as a "very mixed picture".According to {w|BBC News Online}, the average worker's wage was {w|Pound sterling|?}453, including bonuses, in January 2011. In comparison to last year, 2.3% of wages were larger in January of this year, which is less than half of the UK's {w|Retail Price Index}; it currently stands at 5.1%.Overall, the total amount of employed individuals has increased by thirty-two thousand and now stands at 29.16 million, the peak value since autumn 2010. 132,000 {w|Public sector|public sector} occupations were eliminated, whereas 428,000 of them have originated within the {w|Private sector|private sector}.

[[Conflicting reports, mounting fear, over Japanese nuclear disaster]]International frustration is focusing on the slow pace and lack of detail characterizing the updates from Japan. The director general of the {w|International Atomic Energy Agency}, {w|Yukiya Amano}, said Japan needs to provide more frequent and detailed information on the crisis to the world.Currently, the lack of information is particularly important regarding the threat posed by reactor number four. The building housing the reactor is no longer on fire, but smoke or steam is visible on television pictures. Yoshitaka Nagayama, a spokesman for Japan's {w|Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency}, admitted that "[b]ecause we have been unable to go the scene, we cannot confirm whether there is water left or not in the spent fuel pool at Reactor No. 4." Thomas Neff, a reactor safety expert with the {w|Massachusetts Institute of Technology}, said: "The problem is that nobody knows. If you don't know and you're {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO}, you probably underplay it. If you're the {w|Regulatory agency|regulator}, you probably see it in a worse light."

[[Libyan rebels and Gaddafi troops in battle on two fronts]]Libyan government forces and rebel fighters have been fighting in two different cities Wednesday, in both the east and west of the country.Fighting was reported in the cities of {w|Ajdabiya}, an eastern city that is the last settlement before Benghazi, the main rebel location, and in {w|Misrata}, the only town still controlled by rebels in western Libya.  Rebels claimed to have held off government troops in both cities, though dozens of people are reported dead in the latest violence.Control of Ajdabiya has reportedly shifted between government and rebel troops in the past two days. Government forces apparently captured the city during the day on Tuesday, but retreated by evening. On Wednesday, the city was under attack by airplanes, tanks and mortars. At the end of the day, the rebels still appeared to control much of the city.According to a doctor in the city, at least 26 people have died in Ajdabiya in the past two days. On Tuesday, Libyan state TV reported that Ajdabiya was "totally controlled and is being cleansed of armed gangs." However, a rebel official later said that "[t]here's heavy, sustained tank shelling and earlier there were air strikes, but now the revolutionaries managed to take seven tanks from those dogs and, God willing, we will succeed."Rebel leaders also claimed that warplanes and a helicopter under their command had been involved in the fighting, and said they had superior weapons than government forces. Outside the city, however, government forces were reported to be amassing several hundred troops, as well as increasing supplies of ammunition and weaponry.In Misrata, rebels claim that they had repelled government forces using tanks and other artillery weapons, though this could not be confirmed. Eleven people are reported to have died on Wednesday in Misrata.International diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation continue. French president Nicolas Sarkozy wrote to the UN Security Council in support of a proposed resolution that includes the establishment of a no-fly zone in Libya. The international community is still split on the idea of military intervention, though; while the {w|Arab League} supports a no-fly zone, a G8 meeting on Tuesday ended without support for the idea.
[[Japan begins using helicopters to drop water on nuclear plant]]Japanese military helicopters have begun to drop water on the {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Daiichi} nuclear power plant in an effort to cool reactors.The operation began at 0948 local time today, after similar efforts were ended early yesterday due to radiation. {w|Boeing CH-47 Chinook} helicopters dropped four loads of water on reactors three and four, with officials planning up to twelve more drops before crews are forced to leave the area due to radiation.The water drops are intended to both cool the reactors and add water to pools that hold fuel rods. These pools are believed to be almost empty; if they run out of water the fuel rods can melt and release high levels of radiation. The storage pools have a capacity of about 2,000 tonnes of water, a third of that is needed to keep fuel rods submerged. Each helicopter can carry 7.5 tonnes of water at a time.TV footage showed helicopters dropping water from about 300 feet above the reactors. Some time after the helicopters began to drop water, military trucks started using a water cannon to spray reactor three.The crisis at the power plant has led to the evacuation of around 70,000 people who lived within 20 kilometres of the plant, while another 140,000 are under orders to stay inside. The United States has asked its citizens who are within 80 kilometres of the plant to leave.== Sources ==

[[South African serial killer guilty of nineteen rapes, sixteen murders]]A judge in South Africa has convicted a serial killer of 52 crimes, including nineteen rapes, sixteen murders, an attempted murder and nine kidnappings. {W|Jack Mogale} was convicted before {w|Johannesburg} {W|High Courts of South Africa|High Court} on Wednesday of being what police had dubbed the West End Serial Killer. He was today sentenced to twenty concurrent life terms.Mogale's crimes lasted a year from March 2008 to March 2009, coming to an end when police were passed his car's number plate information following a teen's disappearance. He was arrested shortly after the killing of a prostitute he had hired; he was found to have a phone stolen from another victim when he was detained.Whilst the killer was still at-large police named him after the West-End factory, a building materials factory in Waterworks, {w|Westonaria} around which most of the attacks were centred. Other victims were attacked in {W|Lenasia}.Judge Frans Kgomo also chose to convict Mogale, who is in his forties, of three aggravated robberies, {W|sexual assault}, assault with intent to cause {W|grievous bodily harm}, theft or fraud and escaping lawful custody. He cleared the defendant, who took victims to open areas before comitting sexual murders, of nine other charges.41 witnesses testified for the prosecution, including the only two women to survive. Both told the court he had introduced himself as a {W|Zionist Churches|Zionist Christian} preacher and prophet. He wore a Christian Zion badge and {W|sangoma|sangoma beads}, which both victims identified; {w|identity parades} were also submitted as evidence. The accused's distinctive facial scar was recognised by the survivors.The first described his help for a {W|Uterus|uterine} ailment; she said he claimed he needed to have sex with her to exorcise a spirit from her and placed herbs in her vagina, but Mogale countered that they had consensual intercourse as part of an affair. The second said he took her to a veld and attacked her after giving her a lift, knocking her unconscious. Upon awakening the following day she said she had maggot-infested wounds and a dislocated jaw. Her genitals and neck were wounded; her front teeth were missing.Most of the bodies were badly decomposed when they were found. They had mostly been killed by {W|Blunt trauma|blunt force} to the skull, either with a weapon or hitting their heads against the ground, although some were strangled. Two women were {w|Sodomy|sodomized}. DNA and mobile phone records linked him to the crimes. He originally confessed to police."I want you to help me," he told officers after his arrest. "When I am with a woman I lose control and do not know what to do. I kill all of them when they do not give me what I want."Mogale's defence centred on accusations the witnesses - amongst them his partner, Charlotte Manaka - and police were trying to frame him. He said police took a condom used by he and Manaka to obtain forensic evidence to plant. Manaka directly contradicted this in her testimony, saying they did not use condoms, as well as saying Mogale regularly wore the beads and badge identified by victims. The couple have four children.Judge Kgomo noted that "[t]his defence is very suspicious, especially because the DNA kit was compiled long before the accused was even identified as a suspect and long before he was arrested," and that the state witnesses were important to the case. "The accused was not a very good witness... with his contradictions and new versions... at times he wanted to shift blame onto his defence counsel." The judge felt "he was not telling the whole truth" and criticised his failure to produce witnesses to back up his claims.Professor Gerard Labuschagne, who does investigative psychology for the police, was an important witness. He told the court similarities between the various attacks meant they were "undoubtedly by the same offender." Some of the bodies remain unidentified."On the day he was arrested, the accused displayed hatred for women," said judge Kgomo. "He behaved like a psychopath, even showing his manhood to the female police officer. When he met the same policewoman at the station he said, ¡®when I come out of here you will be the first person I rape and kill¡¯." In summary, Kgomo said, "[t]he state has proved beyond reasonable doubt the accused¡¯s guilt.""I didn't do anything," protested Mogale shortly before judgement was handed down. "You know how life is, this is a challenge, I didn¡¯t do any of those things. I don¡¯t even know those women." He has been convicted of rape twice previously.At sentencing today, Judge Kgomo called Mogale an "evil and perverted murderer and rapist who pose[s] extreme danger to women in society." As well as sixteen life terms for the murders, four extra life terms were handed down for raping some women twice. Each of the three aggravated robberies attracted a fifteen-year sentence, each kidnap produced five years, three years for the theft and fraud charge, three for sexual assault, three for escaping custody and five for attempted murder. All the sentences will run concurrently."Sir, there is no way you can be allowed to be out of prison to come into contact with women," Kgomo told Mogale. "I am removing you permanently from society." As Mogale was led away he shouted at the victims' families "[y]ou are also coming, I pray. I will be out soon."== Sources == 
[[New York Times to Start Charging for access to web news]]This story along with the BBC and NYT sources cited, and other media has managed to turn this into a story about settlements rather than the shocking and brutal terrorist attack   almost incidently noted here. Clearly, those who are capable of the premeditated murder of sleeping babies and children together with their parents are driven by something far deeper than an aversion to the existence or building of Israeli settlements.  Yet, many media outlets still chose to politicize the horrific slaughter of innocents by focusing less on the despicable act itself and more on making an issue of the location of the attack.  The BBC virtually buried the Fogel family¡¯s massacre. Instead, it was subsumed in a story of settlements, and warranted only a few lines. The BBC does, however, report that the attack ¡°has shocked many Palestinians¡±. Of course, the BBC failed to mention that Hamas described the attack as a ¡°heroic operation¡± while sweets and candies were handed out in Gaza in celebration . The Palestinian Authority¡¯s continuous incitement in the Palestinian media and education system bear much responsibility. But the media have bought into this narrative of demonization and helped to create such a  toxic environment that the murder of innocents is deemed to be almost acceptable and the human story behind a tragedy is cynically removed.
[[Power line to Japanese nuclear plant completed]]A power line to the {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant} in Japan was completed Thursday, which will allow cooling systems at one of the facility's reactors.The new line, roughly one kilometer in length, connects the power grid to the power plant's second reactor. It was completed at about 1730 local time on Thursday, and will be energized once spraying of seawater over reactor three is complete.According to a {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company} spokesperson, once the power line is energized "we will be able to activate various electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear fuel," thus cooling temperatures within the reactor.The {w|International Atomic Energy Agency} has said that the stricken power plant is currently stable, though there is still the chance of matters growing worse. An official at the agency said that "it's reasonably stable at the moment compared to yesterday."== Sources == 
[[UN Security Council approves Libya no-fly zone]]The United Nations Security Council has approved the establishment of a {w|Libyan no-fly zone|no-fly zone} over Libya after a vote on Thursday evening.  A meeting in New York City resulted in the approval of a resolution that would mark the beginning of "all necessary measures short of an occupation force to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas" in Libya. The vote on the measure passed with ten of the fifteen members of the Security Council in support and {w|Russia}, {w|China}, {w|India}, {w|Germany} and {w|Brazil}  absenting.The resolution had been proposed by the United Kingdom, France and Lebanon. In his remarks introducing the measure before the Council, {w|Alain Juppe}, the French foreign minister, said that "[w]e cannot let these warmongers do this, we cannot abandon civilians."Air attacks on government forces in Libya could take place within hours, flown by the French and British air forces, after NATO meets to review plans for military action.In response to the vote, a statement aired on Libyan state TV said that "[a]ny foreign military act against Libya will expose all air and maritime traffic in the Mediterranean Sea to danger, and civilian and military [facilities] will become targets of Libya's counterattack." Libya's ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, also said that government troops planned to move against Benghazi Thursday night. "No more fear, no more hesitation, the moment of truth has come. [...] There will be no mercy. Our troops will be coming to Benghazi tonight."The UK ambassador to the UN, {w|Mark Lyall Grant}, said after the vote that "[t]he international community has come together in deploring the actions of the Gaddafi regime and demanding that the regime end this violence against the Libyan people."In Benghazi, rebels celebrated the passage of the resolution with fireworks after a live broadcast of the vote was shown on an outdoor projection.

[[Japan raises severity level of crisis; efforts to cool damaged nuclear power plant continue]]As the nuclear crisis in Japan's crippled {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant} appears to worsen, {w|Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|Japan¡¯s nuclear safety agency} raised their assessment of its severity from {w|International_Nuclear_Event_Scale#Level_4:_Accident_with_local_consequences|4} to {w|International_Nuclear_Event_Scale#Level_5:_Accident_with_wider_consequences|5} on the 7-level {w|International Nuclear Event Scale}, the same rating given the 1979 {w|Three Mile Island} crisis. Japan's Prime Minister, {w|Naoto Kan}, said bluntly that the situation at the nuclear power plant was "very grave". Weather forecasts indicate changing winds may begin moving radiation closer to Tokyo by March 30.Efforts thus far to  cool {w|nuclear fuel} in the  reactors and the  spent-fuel pools has produced little if any success, contends United States government officials.Engineers are working frantically to connect electrical power to two reactors in the plant, as well as to restart the cooling systems and  prevent overheating of {w|Nuclear fuel|fuel rods}. {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company|Tokyo Electric Power Co.} stated that it hopes to reconnect a power line needed to restart water pumps to the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors by Saturday morning.  However, a {w|TEPCO} official cautioned  that if the water pumps were damaged by the tsunami, they could fail to restart. The extent of the damage to the plant's reactors is still unclear. Japanese officials have concentrated  on cooling spent fuel rods in  Reactor No. 3's  {w|Spent fuel pool|storage pool}. On Friday, however, steam was seen rising from Reactor No. 2., where an explosion occurred on Tuesday. Additionally, engineers said on Thursday that the steel lining of the storage pool at Reactor No. 4 and its concrete base seemed damaged, as  attempts to refill the pool with water became increasingly difficult.In a briefing on Friday, Philippe Jamet, a commissioner at France's nuclear regulator {w|Autorit¨¦ de s?ret¨¦ nucl¨¦aire|Autorite de Surete Nucleaire},  said, "We must avoid being overly optimistic. This will likely take human intervention like going into control rooms to reconnect valves." == Sources == 
[[United Nations says Ivory Coast shelling may be 'war crime']]After 25 people were killed Thursday by shells fired into the city of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, the United Nations has issued a statement condemning the incident.The shelling on Thursday resulted in around a hundred casualties, 25 of which were deaths. At least six shells were reportedly fired from military barracks into the district of {w|Abobo}, a region that supports Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized president of the Ivory Coast after elections in late 2010.According to the UN, forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, who also claims to have won the election, were responsible for the shelling, though Gbagbo's supporters deny this.The UN said that the incident was an act that "perpetrated against civilians, could constitute a crime against humanity." Secretary General {w|Ban Ki-Moon} said that the UN will "continue to take the necessary steps to protect the civilian population" in the country.A spokesperson for Gbagbo, Ahoua Don Mello, however, denied responsibility for the shelling, claiming that the UN allegations were part of a "conspiracy" with Ouattara and France, the Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, that would result in the removal of Gbagbo from power.France also condemned the shelling, saying it was "deliberate massacre of civilians," and requested that the {w|United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council} impose sanctions against Gbagbo and his allies.Unrest since the presidential election is estimated to have killed 410 people and caused 450,000 people to leave their homes. == Sources ==

The soil under the northbound lane is also in danger of giving way. Drivers heading north were blocked at the {w|Bixby Creek Bridge}; the rest of the  road has been closed to traffic indefinitely. A long closure is expected to hurt the tourist business upon which Big Sur and and the tiny surrounding communities depend.The  {w|California Highway Patrol} said no one was injured.The section that collapsed is on a curve south of the {w|Rocky Creek Bridge},  where the highway clings to  the scenic {w|Santa Lucia Mountains}, and near the Bixby Creek Bridge,  one of the "iconic" {w|arch bridge}s that make this stretch of the highway with its dramatic vistas such a well-known scenic drive.The cause of the collapse was not apparent as the road surface looked new, and no seeping water was visible.

[[45 killed after Yemen protesters fired upon]]45 people have been killed in Yemen after gunmen fired on protesters in the city of {w|Sana'a}. Several hundred more were injured. The origins of the gunmen are not known for certain, but it is believed that both government security forces and civilian supporters of the government are responsible.The shootings occurred shortly after midday prayers when protesters began moving towards a burning car. According to witnesses, several warning shots were fired by security forces before they fired on protesters, soon joined by gunmen on the tops of buildings. President {w|Ali Abdullah Saleh}, however, has denied that the government is responsible for the deaths. He said that "[w]hat happened today was very regrettable, the death of our children." He also ordered a state of emergency, which would ban civilians from bearing weapons, to be declared.One opposition leader termed the incident a "massacre," and called it "part of a criminal plan to kill off the protesters, and the president and his relatives are responsible for the bloodshed in Yemen today." Another said the events have caused there to be "no longer any possibility of mutual understanding" between the opposition and government.Tourism Minister {W|Nabil al-Faqih} resigned in protest after the killings. Another prominent ruling-party member, Mohammed al-Qadhi, said "[w]e condemn these crimes against humanity." He had already resigned last week.

[[UN carries out first review of US human rights record]]The United Nations has completed its first ever assessment of the United States human rights record, which began last November. They made 228 recommendations for improvements. On Friday, the U.S. accepted about 174 of these, agreeing to such recommendations as the humane treatment of terror suspects and repudiation of torture, but rejected the recommendation to drop the {w|death penalty}.The {w|Legal Adviser of the Department of State}, {w|Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh}, listed nine core areas in which the  U.S. agreed to make improvements, including  {w|civil rights}, {w|immigration},  and the humane treatment of suspects held at  {w|Guantanamo Bay detention camp}. Koh said {w|Barack Obama|President Obama}  agreed to  push for ratification of conditions under the {w|Geneva Conventions} and to add protections for international armed conflict detainees. Koh refused to drop the death penalty as many European countries requested, arguing that it was legal under international law.Some nations wanted the U.S. to reduce  {w|prison overcrowding}, prevent {w|racial profiling}, and ratify international treaties protecting the rights of women and children. China and Russia wanted Guantanamo to be shut down. Cuba, Iran and Venezuela said the U.S. was ignoring too many recommendations.The {w|Obama administration|Obama administration} joined the 47-nation {w|UN Human Rights Council} two years ago, allowing for increased international scrutiny.

[[ICANN approves .xxx domain for pornography]]ICANN's decision means success for  the Florida-based {w|ICM Registry}, the company that first applied for the .xxx domain in 2004. ICM will oversee the new domain and  will sell the .xxx Web addresses. ICM hopes that  the establishment of a .xxx domain  will contribute a degree of  predictability and security to the largely unrestrained world of Internet websites.  Its chief executive, Stuart Lawley, said, "For the first time, there will be a clearly defined Web address for adult entertainment, out of the reach of minors and as free as possible from fraud or malicious computer viruses." The decision was criticized  by some of the {w|Internet pornography} industry's biggest players who fear they could be the target of  arbitrary censorship by governments and boards regulating  the .xxx domain.  ICM's Lawley saw only positive outcomes from the decision: "Everybody wins. The consumer of adult sites wins. The providers will benefit because more people will become paying customers. And those who don't want to go there will win as well, because the sites will be easier to filter."== Sources ==

[[Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave overtake Guinness World Record for longest radio DJ team marathon on BBC Radio 1]]Per a past discussion in the proposal section, I've created the Wikinews:Guidelines for class projects. I hope you don't mind me marking this as a policy; but if you do, please add appropriate categories/templates. Hopefully this page will be of use. --Piotrus 22:23, 4 March 2011The review process as implemented on en.Wikinews is strangling the production and publication process, and more importantly is preventing growth of the community.When Wikinews was first established a similar review process was in place. It could neither scale nor support the necessary radical growth model for an online wiki community. When it was scrapped, the community grew rapidly, and article production grew. Both active community and article production peaked when processes for article development were implemented - as soon as "articles in development" were removed from the main page in fact.I don't want to get into arguments about the history of Wikinews. Here is the net concern: if we drop the review process or radically alter it to allow instantaneous publishing with easy unpublishing model we put at risk our listing on Google.Google traffic has been good for en.WN. But it has not increased our editor pool, which ultimately means it is not helping to maintain the project. In my opinion it's worth risking our listing to improve the editor pool size and diversity. The status quo seems to be leading to slow death with a handful of active participants on a cobweb of a news blog. - Amgine | t 18:36, 5 March 2011There are many ways we could relax the review process. The three primary ones are:Is wikinews focused solely on finished news articles, or is it instead focused on the production of news articles? If the latter, then the primary effort should be to make it easy and enjoyable for people to do so. A vibrant stream of articles will contain a percentage of dreck, and the larger the stream the more trash it will carry - but still only a percentage of the total flow. In my opinion the filtering systems in place now have nearly stopped the flow entirely. - Amgine | t 18:36, 5 March 2011Thanks Tempo, useful. Having been thinking this over since Amgine's initial post, perhaps the move required is to scrap necessity for review for certain people. This still leaves the problem of getting electric cattle-prods up people's bums to review newbies' work, though, which is the hardest - but, without factchecking stuff from users known to get it right, we might see more people going in for it. Once people know what they're doing, they get the right to publish handed out to them. Blood Red Sandman 19:50, 5 March 2011I'm curious about the early days review process that was in place; it obviously predated the technical ability to enforce an independent review, but how does it stack up against what we've got now? /* Wiki War-Zone */  AGI is, from my point of view, a massive red herring; it should not feature in this discussion. A publicist spamming Wikinews with a presser is "acting with good intentions", but not to the benefit of the project. I would class blind reproduction of VoA, BBC, RT.com, or China's state controlled media as the same.So, there's a need to take several steps back and ask what is Wikinews supposed to achieve? Perhaps, looking at what has been achieved already.However, the way I see it we are not redundant with 'pedia because we have a different process, a different format of article, and a different scope. Bawolff ?? 06:11, 6 March 2011Up-front, we can't implement a de-publish process without something like the GNews sitemap. Or, accepting delisting when we're caught with nonsense being self published. That isn't what I'd like to see.Self-publish for well-established contributors is also a less-than-critical issue. Most longer-term, quality contributors know someone can be persuaded to review their work more on the basis of a copyedit and casual factcheck. {unsigned|Brian McNeil|22:52, 5 March 2011}Personally, I'm insulted every single time someone, almost invariably a Wikipedian, says Wikinews is "not a reliable source". I would be deeply unhappy to see that become reality as the only way to increase contributor base. Many of the somewhat provocative suggested solutions seem that way to me.As to the '06 contributor drop; we had a vibrant antipodean set of pre-college contributors. Since stepping up to university they no longer have time to devote here. --Brian McNeil / talk 22:52, 5 March 2011I may be completely off-base here, but let me restate what I *think* this branch of the conversation is about: over-regulation/over-process is raised as a problem for growth and development, and a proposed solution is to expand over-regulation/over-process to incremental review stages. Did I get that correctly? - Amgine | t 18:09, 6 March 2011[More commonly known as a required section break.]Forgive the section break heading, it's an old political joke - and indicative of what seems a circular set of arguments being presented.At one extreme we've anarchy and no review - with what would become conflict with unpublishing and so on.At the other end we've the physist and engineer, the latter arguing that they can reach a goal by covering half the remaining distance in each step.What, as concise bullet points, are the arguments in favour or against either? --Brian McNeil / talk 23:15, 6 March 2011I'll admit, my "In a nutshell" piece is ~14KB. However, that uses repetition, and puts decoration at the end - so you could have the fundamentals by the time you're a third of the way through it.Lastly, to be blunt, the tour's colour scheme is . --Brian McNeil / talk 18:00, 9 March 2011The wiki contributor statistics for January are now out and available here, and even I, expecting a bad result, was surprised:There shouldn't be any question now that we're headed on a downward spiral. We need to start looking at how to get our userbase back in a broader sense, not just the review process. February stats should be available shortly as well, for comparison. Tempodivalse 
[[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|[talk]]] 16:35, 10 March 2011---- There are ongoing discussions relating to making it possible to increase the userbase. Posting statistical evidence for an already known problem does not solve such.I don't want to try and rehash such here, but will briefly lay out some points:To try and sum up, a 'carrot and stick' approach is required. The project cannot roll back to free-for-all self-publish. To me, and others who care about their work being viewed as credible and trustworthy, the review process is a must. To new contributors, there must be a "shallow end of the pool" that hooks them into contributing then pushes their standards up to a more formally reviewed level.What I think is needed is technically possible; it will need a lot of policy work too, possibly some gadget work. I have not time now to fully expound on this, but will as time permits. I would say that people who've no experience pre-FlaggedRevs should look to the edit wars before they joined. That will rear its head again, but an argumentative community that shares the project's broad objectives would be more healthy. --Brian McNeil / talk 23:11, 11 March 2011I just copied :Template:Copied to here from Wikipedia which I guess is unacceptable. So I guess I have to obtain permission from each and every contributor to that template. Any reword is going to be sub-par. Just wondering if I on the right track. Also there is no inter-wikinews attribution policy here. If I copy something from within Wikinews onto another Wikinews article do I even need this template or is an edit summary attributing the author good enough? The attribute template was only added to Wikipedia in June 2009 so maybe it is just not that important. Marcus Qwertyus 06:05, 11 March 2011
[[Crucifixes can be displayed in state schools, European court rules]]The {w|Strasbourg|Strasbourg}-based {w|European Court of Human Rights} ruled unanimously yesterday that state school classrooms displaying {w|crucifixes} do not violate the rights of non-Catholic pupils.In a reversal of the unanimous November 2009 decision the court said, although the crucifix is "above all a {w|Religious symbolism|religious symbol}", it is an "essentially passive symbol" and there is no evidence crucifixes displayed on classroom walls influence pupils.The court's final ruling reverses their 2009 decision in a case brought by a Finnish-born mother living in Italy who objected to the {w|Roman Catholic} symbols in her children's classrooms on the grounds that they violated the {w|Secularity|secular} principles state schools should uphold. The court agreed, saying the crucifix might be "emotionally disturbing for pupils of other religions or those who profess no religion". But the decision created a vociferous outcry in many European countries, such as Italy, which argued the crucifix is a {w|Culture|cultural} symbol, and a part of Europe's culture and history.The appeal was handled by {w|New York University} legal scholar {w|Joseph Weiler}, arguing extreme secularism could threaten the use of British national anthem {w|God Save the Queen}.Italy's foreign minister, {w|Franco Frattini}, welcomed the reversal. According to the newspaper {w|La Repubblica} he said, "The decision underlines, above all, the rights of citizens to defend their own values and their own identities. I hope that following this verdict Europe will begin to examine issues of tolerance and religious freedom with the same courage." Friday's ruling is binding on the 47 countries that are members of the {w|Council of Europe}, the continent's monitor of human rights, paving the way for petitions to other governments to allow religious symbols in schools for those who want them.== Sources ==

[[Haiti votes in presidential runoff]]Voters in Haiti are  going  to the polls today  to vote for  the country's  next {w|President of Haiti|president}. The election follows  months of political turmoil after  the corrupt first round election in November caused a crisis requiring international intervention.   Haiti is still struggling to recover from  the devastating January 2010 earthquake, with about one million people remaining in squalid, temporary shelters and a recent  {w|cholera|cholera epidemic} which threatens to break out again with the return of the rainy season. Observers are  hoping the new president will restore enough  stability so rebuilding efforts can begin with international help.In Haiti¡¯s first round of balloting in November, names were missing from voter rolls, ballot boxes were stuffed or trashed, voters were blocked from the precincts by supporters of candidates, among other irregularities. Haitians rioted, plunging the process into chaos that was quelled by the determined efforts of foreign monitors. Out of the original 19 candidates, two remained after the first round: {w|Mirlande Manigat}, age 70, a sedate, reserved university professor and wife of former president {w|Leslie Manigat}, and pop star {w|Sweet Micky|"Sweet Micky" Martelly}, age 50, who the {w|The Washington Post} described as being "a popular {w|Compas music|kompa} singer [...] famous for dropping his pants on stage, mooning audiences, and dressing in {w|Drag queen|drag} ¡ª or sometimes a diaper."However, Martelly has waged an energetic, well financed campaign with  pink campaign posters picturing his smiling face and bald head, cultivating a {w|Populism|populist} image with  Haiti¡¯s  poor. He has been successful at marketing himself as an  unpretentious outsider who will shake up the political system and yank the country out of its paralysis. At the same time, he has  courted the upper class with a platform containing pro-business promises and support for the return of the {w|Haitian army}.The sedate personality of Manigat contrasts starkly with that of Martelly. She portrays herself as a dignified, mature mother figure able to nurture Haiti through its troubles. The determining factor may be the popular former president {w|Jean-Bertrand Aristide}, who  returned two days ago to Haiti from South America after seven years in exile. Aristide has not endorsed either candidate, but Aristide supporters, among those Haitians most desperately poor, have voiced support for Manigat. Upon Aristide's arrival, there were banners saying, "My mother is here already. Welcome home Father", according to The Washington Post.Pierre-Marie Boisson, a private-sector economist in Haiti, sees the candidates as having similar platforms, promising jobs, housing and free education, even if their personal styles are so different. "They have both promised the moon to the voters," he said. He noted that this puts tremendous pressure on the winner to produce results quickly in a world where the price of food and fuel is rising.As voting concluded, despite some irregularities such as  missing ballots and  late starts, authorities concluded  the voting went well, without the pervasive  fraud that marked the November election. Colin Granderson, head of {w|Organization of American States} observer mission, said the runoff election was a great improvement over the previous one.The final results will be announced on April 16.== Sources ==

The sale would reduce the number of significant carriers in the US from four to three and is expected to close fully in about one year.

Electoral officials said 77% of voters endorsed  a set of {w|constitutional amendment|constitutional amendments} that included  limiting presidential terms, removing limitations on forming {w|political parties}, and holding  a {w|general election} within six months.Many of the mostly {w|Secularity|secular} protest leaders who headed the revolution leading to President Hosni Mubarak's resignation were opposed to the amendments, not wanting to hold elections so quickly.

This is in contrast to parliamentary elections held four months ago, when the turnout was only six million.Although there were some problems at the voting places, observers said these were mostly due to the military's hasty preparations, not wrongdoing by officials. Opposition leader Mohammed ElBaradei was prevented from voting by men throwing stones in the worst incidence of sporadic violence.The results were met with jubilation by Egyptians; in Cairo, horns were honked and fireworks set off. The elections are considered the first in decades not rigged in favor of one party."It's not important what the result is, it's important that it was fair," said a revolutionary leader, Abdul Rahman Yusuf.== Sources ==

[[Existing US home sales fall 9.6% in February]]Sales of existing homes  in the U.S. fell 9.6% in February, the {w|National Association of Realtors} said today, in a sign that the U.S. housing market is still {w|Depression|depressed}.  The figure was worse than the 3.9% decline anticipated by the  economists surveyed by {w|Dow Jones Newswires}   and questions whether the  U.S. housing market is beginning to recover  or will continue to fall.A combination of {w|foreclosure}s and {w|Short sale|short sales},  where the mortgage holder sells the house for less than owed on the {w|mortgage}, accounted for almost 40% of the  sales. Millions of foreclosures have forced down home prices and the number of foreclosures are predicted to rise this year. The inventory of existing homes listed for sale rose 3.5% at the end of February, a 8.6-month supply at the current sales rate. As more homes are listed in the spring, the inventory of houses for sale will probably increase. A five or six month inventory is usually considered a healthy balance between {w|supply and demand}.According to {w|Moody's Analytics}, another 3.6 million bank-owned  homes and possible foreclosures will be added to the inventory by 2013, adding to the 6.7 million home foreclosures since 2006. Thus housing inventories will probably continue to remain high, delaying the point when prices stabilize. The median sales price in February fell 5.2%, down  to a price level not seen since  April 2002."We have an uneven, choppy recovery,"  said NAR's chief economist {w|Lawrence Yun}.

It is said that the couple, who have been married for eight years, have done so so that Torres can apply for presidency.The couple applied for divorce on March 11, Escobar said. He says the couple have given mutual consent and did not reveal the names of their lawyers.Presidential spokesman Giusseppe Calvinisti has denied having any information about the planned divorce.Before Escobar made the announcement, opposition leader Roxanna Baldetti had warned that the couple were planning to split to let Torres run for the presidency. Many political observers believe the couple filed their request so that Torres can stand to succeed her husband when his term ends in September, as the Guatemalan constitution does not allow close relatives of the president to do so.Comments on the divorce have ranged from 'unthinkable' to 'a fraud', the latter description by {W|Patriotic Party} candidate {w|Otto Perez}. According to Perez, the divorce will not let the Torres run for presidency. "The law does not state a time frame of when a person ceases to be a relative of the President."The {w|Constitutional Court} in Guatemala, the highest legal authority that determines the legitimacy of a presidential candidate, is to be taken over by new members in April. Legal experts doubt the impartiality of the new judges. They noticed 'ominous signs of political pressures' that would cause them to defend partisan interests rather than uphold justice.

[[Petition urges Apple to remove 'anti-gay' app]]Apple is being accused of anti-gay discrimination after it made available  a free app for the {w|iPhone} and {w|iPad} that aims to help "homosexual strugglers" through bible teaching. The app was released in mid-February by {w|Exodus International}, a Christian ministry that wants to provide a "refuge for people looking for help in their journey out of homosexuality." To date, over 130,000 people have signed a petition requesting Apple to withdraw the app.The app was developed  by Exodus International. The statement on its website says, "Exodus is a Christian ministry that supports those wanting to reconcile their faith with their sexual behavior." It stresses that Apple has given the app a "4+" rating meaning it  contains "no objectionable content." The app gives users "freedom from homosexuality through the power of Jesus", according to the group.Wayne Besen, leader of Truth Wins Out, says the message of Exodus International constitutes hate speech.Jeff Buchanan of  Exodus International, said the app is intended to reach those that  share the church's beliefs. "We are reaching those with unwanted same sex attraction," he said. "We were disappointed to see this petition. What we're asking for is fair and equal representation on the Apple platform. We see this as a religious freedom." The issue highlights the problems Apple faces if it becomes involved in policing the content of the countless religious apps in its store, any of which has the potential to be offensive to someone. "It's an issue of tolerance," Buchanan said. "We're simply asking that we have the same opportunity to voice our message as others."Apple is well known for strictly monitoring the content of  the apps offered to users of its gadgets, and excludes sexually explicit material, offensive speech and images, and last November banned an app that entreated users to speak out against gay marriage. == Sources ==

[[Detroit¡¯s population drops by one-fourth in the last decade]]Figures released by  the {w|2010 United States Census|U.S. 2010 census} on Wednesday show that the city of  {w|Detroit} has lost approximately 238,270 people, one-fourth of its total,  since {w|2000 United States Census |2000}. Detroit,  once one of the top five U.S. cities in population, has its  lowest number of residents since 1910.Population numbers affect  the the amount of federal and state funding a city  receives. In the last few decades, dozens of Michigan state laws have been passed allowing Detroit, because its population was at least 750,000,  special measures to raise revenue and  allocating it a  larger share of Michigan's state revenue than its population warranted. Now that  Detroit's population has fallen to 713,777, it is no longer eligible for these financial advantages.The mayor of Detroit, {w|Dave Bing} plans to appeal the census results. He says more than 35,000 residents were not counted."Every person that¡¯s counted in the census brings approximately $10,000 to Detroit over the next decade for schools, roads, hospitals, and social service programs," Bing explained. "Additionally, we could lose millions in {w|Tax levies|statutory revenue} sharing from the state. We are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar. We can¡¯t afford to let these results stand."Detroit was  the fifth largest  U.S. city in 1950.  The decline of the  {w|Big Three|auto industry} hastened the population loss already diminished by the {w|1967 Detroit riot|1967 riots}  that precipitated   {w|white flight} to the suburbs.

It  already lost one congressional seat since the 1980s. Andrew Beveridge, {w|Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College} sociology professor, attributed Detroit's population decline to the loss of its industrial base.

[[China plans to ban smoking in indoor public places]]Yesterday the {w|Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Health Ministry} claimed that China issued a national ban on smoking in all indoor public spaces. The ban is included in the government's {w|12th_Five-Year_Plan_#The_Twelfth_Five-Year_Guideline.2C_2011.E2.80.932015|12th Five-Year Plan}. Also banned is smoking in outdoor public areas where pedestrians pass. The ban will begin May 1.China, with a third of the world's smoking population at 300 million smokers, is the largest cigarette market in the world. Each week approximately 70 percent of non-smoking adults are exposed to {w|Passive smoking|second-hand smoke}. According the the {w|Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention}, tobacco-related illnesses kill over one million people annually. The World Health Organisation says Chinese smoking-related deaths account for one fifth of deaths from smoking world-wide.The number of deaths are predicted to rise to 3.5 million deaths a year by 2030 if no steps are taken, states a report co-authored by Zhao Ping, deputy director general of the Chinese Cancer Foundation. Further, there is a spike  of new smokers in China as increasingly women, young people and the poor become smokers. The posting of logos is being required to alert people not to smoke. Vending machines selling cigarettes in public places will  be banned as will cigarette advertisements and sponsorships. The new regulations include educational measures  to inform  people about the dangers of tobacco. == Sources == 
[[NATO to take control of Libyan no-fly zone]]NATO has agreed to take control of the no-fly zone in Libya as early as this weekend, after a unanimous vote to do so by all 28 member states.Only the no-fly zone will be the responsibility of NATO forces; other military operations in Libya will remain under the control of the group of nations already involved. A two-level command system will be put in place, with political oversight being the responsibility of a new committee headed by NATO but also including other countries that are engaged in military operations in Libya. Deployment of military assets will fall under the purview of NATO alone.An agreement was reached on Wednesday afternoon, after a conference call between US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, British foreign secretary William Hague, French foreign minister {w|Alain Juppe}, and the Turkish foreign minister.  This was proposed to the {w|North Atlantic Council}, and NATO secretary-general {w|Anders Fogh Rasmussen} later confirmed that all NATO members had agreed to implement it.Turkey and France had previously disagreed over the issue of NATO control, with France opposed and Turkey in favor of having NATO command of military forces.Hague said of the agreement that "this is a new coalition, put together very quickly for obvious reasons last week, and so there are bound to be issues to sort out in its management. But we are getting through those pretty well."
[[Japanese earthquake death toll surpasses ten thousand]]The death toll from the Sendai earthquake has now increased to over ten thousand. In Japan, the {w|National Police Agency|National Police Agency} has stated that 10,019 are now known to have been killed as a result of the disaster.The Agency also reported that 2,775 had been injured and the location of 17,541 individuals was unknown. Meanwhile, 1,900 evacuation sites are now thought to be occupied by approximately a quarter of a million people.When the event happened two weeks ago, 18,000 thousand households were destroyed and 130,000 were damaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. In spite of this, twelve of the fifteen north-eastern ports of Japan have recommenced operating, while the majority of the oil terminals of the country remained open, according to Inchcape Shipping Services.Amongst the aftermath of the earthquake, plant number 3 at the {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant} is suspected to have been damaged and may be releasing radiation. The {w|Government of Japan|Japanese government} have reported that an ongoing investigation is occurring to attempt to discover the cause of the radiation leak at the power plant. Chinese authorities have reported two Japanese tourists were found to have levels of radiation "seriously exceeding limits" on their clothing and luggage. In Tokyo, the amount of radiation in the supply of water has decreased, however it remains high in various parts of the north of Japan.According to {w|BBC News Online}, two workers were hospitalised because of the leak. {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company|The Tokyo Electric Power Company}, who operate the building, reported that three employees placing electrical cables at the location were given treatment for being exposed to radioactive water; they had experienced ten thousand times the regular amount of radioactivity. Of those three men, beta rays caused two of them to receive burns. The two individuals did not stop working despite meters advising of unsafe radiation levels. It was later discovered that they were wearing inadequate protective footwear and failed to draw their attention to a radiation alert. TEPCO has since received government orders to improve worker management.The radiation emitted from the plant has had a significant effect on the Japanese food industry. In the surrounding areas of the plant, shipments of foodstuffs have been prohibited. In {w|Fukushima prefecture}, residents have been advised not to consume eleven leafy green vegetable types produced locally due to radiation concerns. There has also been a significant decrease in customer demand at a fish market in {w|Tsukiji}.Japanese product importers have discovered some foodstuffs to have a small radiation amount, which is not thought to be potentially deadly. Numerous Asian countries, the European Union, Australia, Russia and the United States have prohibited milk items, seafood and vegetables from being imported from various Japanese prefectures.Closing the power plant down may take at least one month to achieve. Speaking to {w|AFP}, an individual talking on behalf of TEPCO stated that the company is "still in the process of assessing the damage at the plant, so that we can't put a deadline on when the cooling operations will work again". Residents living within thirty kilometres of the plant have been advised to avoid going outdoors to attempt to prevent radiation exposure as far as possible.
[[Situation at damaged nuclear power plant remains 'very grave', says Japanese Prime Minister]]Two weeks after a disastrous earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, the {w|Fukushima I nuclear accidents|situation at the severely damaged} {w|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant} has been described by the Prime Minister as "very grave and serious". In a nationally televised report to the nation on Friday, {w|Naoto Kan} said the Japanese government was "not in a position where we can be optimistic."Radiation is reported to still be leaking from the plant, in {w|Fukushima prefecture}. "The source of the radiation seems to be the {w|Nuclear reactor core|reactor core}," said {w|Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency} official Hidehiko Nishiyama, adding that radiation was "more likely" coming from the core than from the reactor's {w|spent fuel pool}.  On Thursday three workers stepped into contaminated cooling water in the reactor's turbine room  while trying  to replace cables at  reactor No. 3, Nishiyama said. The water seeped into the the boots of two of the workers, touching their skin and causing lesions; the third worker's clothing  protected him from the water. The two workers with skin lesions were hospitalized for radiation exposure. The radiation level of the contaminated water measured 10,000 times the level of cooling water in an undamaged reactor.Work has been stopped on attempts to reattach a permanent power line to the {w|Cooling_system_#Cooling|cooling system} in reactor No. 3, and the building has been evacuated. Nishiyama could give no predictions of when work would resume. The possibility that water is leaking from the core of reactor No. 3 increases the danger for workers who attempt to cool the crippled plant. The reactors must be cooled before more safety work can begin. Japan had been using seawater for cooling  since the disaster crippled the power plant's cooling systems, but U.S. officials were concerned that  saltwater could harm the  equipment, causing it to seize up and corrode, thereby worsening the situation.== Sources ==

[[BBC cancel television comedy series 'My Family']]The BBC have made the decision to cancel {w|My Family}, a televised {w|Sitcom|situation comedy} series which airs on {w|BBC One} in the United Kingdom. {w|Danny Cohen}, who is the Controller of the television channel, stated: "Now that all the Harper children have fled the nest we feel it's time to make room for new comedies".The programme, which was created by {w|Fred Barron}, launched in September 2000. It was the first {w|BBC Television} series of this genre to make use of production methods originating from the United States, including a group of employed writers and the studio being used solely for the purposes of the sitcom during the process of production. Over one hundred episodes of the show have been created since that time.Series ten of My Family, which was broadcast in the summer of 2010, received approximately 4.6 million viewers on average. The eleventh and final series of the show is expected to be broadcast on BBC One later in 2011. Cohen has stated that {w|Robert Lindsay|Robert Lindsay} and {w|Zo? Wanamaker}, who both feature in the TV show, will continue to be "part of our BBC One comedy family."Meanwhile, Cheryl Taylor, commissioning controller for comedy at the BBC, explained: "Now that almost a generation of British children have grown up with the Harper brood, played over the years by Kris Marshall, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Gabriel Thompson, we're looking to the future with new families and new comedies that we hope will prove equally popular." Speaking to {w|The Daily Telegraph}, actor Robert Lindsay explained how he was "amazed by the public's love for the series." "When Kris Marshall left in 2005 I was convinced that was it. But somehow Zoe and I have kept the essence of it together," he said.In response to the announcement of the cancellation of My Family, English actress {w|Miranda Hart} made comments about the story in an audio clip available on {w|BBC News Online}. "After 10-11 years, it's not a slight to be taken off-air. It's an amazing achievement and I think it's done a lot for studio audience sitcoms," she said. "It became a bit 'uncool', for one to address a word, but I always stood by it. [...] Having that many viewers says it all, really. [...] I think it's amazing what they achieved." Hart thought that the show will be remembered "[p]robably with Robert and Zo?. You know, they put a lot of work in and they did fantastic performances, you know, that really endeared the nation to them," describing Lindsay and Wanamaker as "great comedy actors."== Sources == 
[[Qatar becomes first Arab country to fly fighter jets over Libya]]Qatar participated in a combat mission  to enforce a {w|no-fly zone} over Libya on Friday, one day after NATO agreed to take command. Qatar is  the first Arab country to take part in the  operation against Moammar Gadhafi's regime. The {w|French Defence Ministry} said two Qatai {w|Dassault_Mirage_2000#Mirage_2000-5|Mirage 2000 interceptor fighters} flew Qatar's first sortie over Libya  accompanied by a French jet.Besides Qatar, the United Arab Emirates has agreed to  send 12 warplanes to support the international no-fly alliance.  No other countries from the {w|Arab League} have agreed to join so far. Qatar's combat deployment as the first by an Arab or Muslim-majority country  thus is of  critical impact.Qatar's participation has great  diplomatic importance. Major General Margaret Woodward, Commander of {w|United States Africa Command|U.S. Air Forces Africa}, stated: "Having our first Arab nation join and start flying with us emphasizes that the world wants the innocent Libyan people protected from the atrocities perpetrated by pro-regime forces".The emir of Qatar has typically preferred subtle diplomacy  rather than confrontation, as Qatar is vulnerable because of its tiny size and its position on the tip of the Arabian peninsula.  Qatar's decision to send planes is  related to its need to  maintain  its independence from its bigger  neighbors like  Iran and Saudi Arabia, according to  {w|The Guardian|The Guardian}.France, the United Kingdom and the United States are among thirteen states which have so far joined the no-fly mission over Libya. The {w|2011 military intervention in Libya|no-fly zone over Libya} was established by the UN Security Council on March 17.== Sources == 
[[Thousands gather in London to protest against government cuts]]Hundreds of thousands of people joined marches in London on Saturday against public sector cuts by the {w|United Kingdom coalition government|British government}. One union estimated up to half a million people travelled from across the country to demonstrate as the {w|Conservative Party|Conservative}¨C{w|Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat} coalition implements wide-ranging spending cuts.According to reports, a small group of protesters dressed in black threw paint and smoke bombs at the {w|Oxford Street} branch of {w|Topshop}, and demonstrators in {w|Piccadilly} threw smoke bombs at the {w|Ritz Hotel}. The protests have targeted the government and a number of retail outlets, following on from the {w|UK Uncut} campaign which has demonstrated outside retailers including Vodafone and Topshop to raise awareness of alleged tax system abuses by the businesses.

[[Millions to turn off lights for Earth Hour tonight]]The {w|World Wide Fund for Nature}, organizers of the fifth annual {w|Earth Hour}, is asking people all over the world to turn off lights tonight from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. local time in support of energy conservation and  awareness of climate change. In 2010, 128 countries,  4,000 cities and  1,000 landmarks worldwide  participated in Earth Hour, including 13 million people in the UK.In a statement on their website, the WWF said, "Every year Earth Hour asks individuals, businesses and communities worldwide to show their commitment to the environment. This Earth Hour, we hope you will turn off your lights. But when the lights go back on, we want you to go beyond the hour and think about what you can change in your daily life that will benefit the planet. Let¡¯s work together to create a better future. Our actions can add up." Promotion by world leaders such as {w|Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General} {w|Ban Ki-moon} is encouraging wide participation in  Earth Hour 2011. This year about 130 countries are expected to take part. Such world landmarks as the {w|Eiffel Tower},  {w|Christ the Redeemer|Christ the Redeemer statue} in Brazil, {w|Big Ben}, the {w|Las Vegas Strip}, the {w|Burj Al Arab|Burj al Arab Hotel} in Dubai, the {w|Acropolis in Athens}, the {w|Sydney Opera House} and   {w|Forbidden City|Beijing's Forbidden City} are expected to go black. The 15 100-foot-tall "iconic" towers at the {w|Los Angeles International Airport} will turn green and then go black for an hour, the airport announced in a press release. In 2011, Scotland became  the first country in the world to obtain Earth Hour cooperation from all of its cities and local jurisdictions, reported  Dr Richard Dixon, director of WWF Scotland, emphasizing that Scotland was going all out this year for Earth Hour. He said, "With record support from cities, local authorities, iconic landmarks, schools and other organisations people will be left in no doubt that Scotland cares about tackling climate change."Dixon praised the efforts of   the organizers of Earth Hour: "WWF's Earth Hour has a unique ability to unite and empower people around the world."== Sources == 
[[Mayor of London Boris Johnson announces bidders for additional Tramlink vehicles]]On Thursday, London's Mayor {w|Boris Johnson} announced the shortlist of bidders to supply up to ten further trams to {w|Transport for London} for use on the city's {w|Tramlink} network in Croydon. The trams will be used to supply additional capacity on the network between Elmers End, central Croydon and Therapia Lane ¡ª one of the most congested parts of the route.TfL, who purchased the Tramlink network from Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. in 2008, announced the plans late January, after submitting the tender to the Official Journal of the European Union on January 29. According to the notice, the additional trams will operate approximately 75,000km per year, will be needed for "at least 10, but not more than 20 years" and can be either new build or existing vehicles that can be modified ¡ª at a reasonable cost ¡ª to run on the Tramlink infrastructure.The tram fleet is currently made up of 24 {w|Bombardier_Transportation|Bombardier} {w|CR4000} trams, which were constructed for the opening of the 28km network  between 1998 and 2000. 22 of these trams are currently needed to operate the three tram routes each day, and the new service is expected to require at least an additional five trams daily, bringing about the need for a boost to the fleet levels.The shortlist to supply the trams consists of {w|Edinburgh Trams|City of Edinburgh}/{w|Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF}, {w|Stadler Rail|Stadler} and {w|PESA SA|Pesa (Pojazdy Szynowe PESA Bydgoszcz S.A.Holding}, and the the three consortia will now be invited to submit proposals to supply the additional trams. The {w|Call for bids|Invitation to Tender} will run for four weeks.It is not currently known whether the bids made by Stadler and Pesa will be for new-build or second-hand vehicles, however the bid from Edinburgh/CAF is to use a number of the currently-dormant trams that were constructed for that city's own tram network. The system has had several set backs since construction began, with the network now set to open in stages with a number of tram lines being cancelled, leading to a large surplus of vehicles that could be hired out in the short term. The trams are amongst some of the longest and heaviest in Europe, though, and will require a large amount of modification to enable them to be able to operate on Croydon's network if the bid is successful.Shortly after the announcement, whilst inspecting one of the network's current trams at East Croydon tram stop, Boris Johnson said: "I have no greater responsibility as Mayor than to ensure people can move around this city with ease, comfort and reliability."Trams in Croydon have proved a major success and this is reflected in journey numbers which have soared by 45 per cent since the network opened in 2000."I look forward to the extra vehicles developing this vital, much-appreciated, and indeed attractive, form of transport further."Funding for the new trams is expected to largely come from TfL, however the London Borough of Croydon has also confirmed a ?3m contribution to the project. This will also include the refurbishment of tram stop surrounds."There is real support to get additional trams for Croydon to keep pace with growing demand for Tramlink services and also to secure major improvements for pedestrians and transport users around and between East and West Croydon stations."TfL anticipates that, providing a successful bid is made, the new trams would be delivered to the network's depot at Therapia Lane in late 2011, with an entry into service from early 2012.== Sources ==

[[Battle for Trafalgar Square, London as violence breaks out between demonstrators and riot police]]Sunday morning showed {w|Trafalgar Square}, London damaged during the night by demonstrators.Bottles, cans, and placards littered the concrete ground of one of the most iconic landmarks in London. Demonstrators livid at government cuts had sprayed graffiti on the four bronze lions. "No-one rules if no-one obeys," one message, next to the symbol of {w|anarchy}, read. On the steps leading up to the {w|National Gallery} lay placards, dropped by demonstrators the night before. Hours earlier the square was an arena for running battles between the anarchist protesters and riot police.First, they targetted {w|Oxford Street}, arguably the most famous shopping row in the city. The protesters, many dressed in black, hurled smoke bombs and paint at {w|Topshop}, which they claimed has systematically abused the tax system. In Piccadilly, they ransacked {w|The Ritz}, a hotel popularly known for upmarket opulence. As darkness fell over the capital, many went home. But in Trafalgar Square, protesters lit campfires and danced to music, smoking and eating into the night.But then the police moved in. Clad in riot gear, the situation began to escalate and both they and the demonstrators began to panic. They raised their batons and shouted at the crowd, while the protesters grabbed metal barriers and hurled them over police lines, using them as battering rams. Some protesters yelled in defence, "Don't hit us!", while the more determined shouted, "Shame on you! Your job's next!" The riot officers pushed protesters into the centre of the square, towards {w|Nelson's Column}. The police started forward at least twice swinging their batons in the air, as protesters retaliated by throwing glass bottles and coins towards the police lines. One officer was taken away with blood pouring from under his visor."I have never seen such a fast escalation of violence in my life," one witness to the violence in the square said. "Everything just kicked off, glass everywhere, police hitting people, people being dragged across the floor. I just can't believe it." Other protesters on the front line later described the police retaliation as they began to {w|kettling|kettle} people in. "I find myself in front of the riot line," one protester wrote, "taking a blow to the head and a kick to the shin; I am dragged to my feet by a girl with blue hair who squeezes my arm and then raises a union flag defiantly at the cops." As the street cleaners worked through the morning in London, more than 200 protesters, detained throughout the day, remained in custody. Although the organisers of the march were swift to disassociate themselves with the violence, the protesters were defiant. "I'm not moving, I'm not moving," one young protester, hemmed in by the riot police, said. "I've been on every protest, I won't let this government destroy our future without a fight. I won't stand back, I'm not moving."== Sources ==

Construction of the two lines, which will take the system to {w|Chilwell} and {w|Clifton,_Nottingham|Clifton}, could begin before the end of the year.The plans were originally turned down on cost grounds, but following successful negotiations between {w|Nottingham City Council} and the two companies bidding to construct the line enough savings have been found to allow the scheme to receive the green light. Around 20% is now believed to have been saved from the cost of the project, though no exact figures of either the original cost or savings made have been announced by the council, and according to a transport boss the project has had no changes made to it to accommodate these.Under the {w|private finance initiative} deal, which is how the funding for phase 2 will be secured, private firms bid to win the contract to build and run the tram network, before then later leasing it back to the council who pay for its use on an ongoing basis. The two consortia bidding to build and operate the network are Tramlink Nottingham and Arrow Connect, the preferred bidder of which will appointed in the near future.However, despite the news of the approval for the lines by the Government, the final hurdle has not yet been jumped, and they could still never make it off the drawing board. The announcement only means that Nottingham City Council ¡ª who are the sole promoters of the scheme following the withdrawal of the {w|Conservative_Party_|Tory}-led {w|Nottinghamshire_County_Council|County Council} ¡ª can continue the process and, if the final business case is given full approval, will then be able to award the concessionaire contract to the successful bidder.The NET system was opened in March 2004, and the original line, Line One, runs for a distance of 14km between {w|Hucknall} and {w|Nottingham|Nottingham City Centre}, with a short spur also serving Phoenix Park ¡ª near to the {w|M1 motorway}. Once completed, Lines Two and Three, operating to Clifton via {w|Wilford} and Chilwell via the {w|Queen's Medical Centre} and {w|Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston}, will continue on from the current terminus at Station Street, over a new bridge across {w|Nottingham railway station}, and diverge to their separate termini shortly afterwards. The lines will add a further 17.4km to the network.After making the announcement on Thursday, Transport Minister {w|Norman Baker} said: ¡°Line One of the Nottingham tram has proved to be a great success in encouraging people on to public transport. These proposed extensions provide the opportunity to continue this success, and give people in the south of Nottingham quicker, more convenient access to the city centre, as well as helping to regenerate sections of the city."Following the spending review last year, we challenged Nottingham City Council to look again at the cost of the Nottingham light rail extension, to be funded through the private finance initiative, to ensure we get maximum value for every pound we spend."The Department has been working closely with the local authority involved to ensure this project is affordable. I am delighted that the Council has risen to the challenge and has identified savings from its original estimated costs."By finding savings, I can confirm that we are today allowing this project to move another step forward within our funding approval process.¡± Nottingham City Council¡¯s Chief Executive Jane Todd also commented: ¡°This is a very positive development. We have worked hard with government to ensure that NET phase two is delivered as cost effectively as possible. A preferred bidder will now be appointed in the very near future who will work with the council to finalise contracts which will hopefully be signed later in the summer. NET Phase Two is crucial for the future of Nottingham's economy and to attract new jobs to the City¡±.If final approval is given for the lines, construction work will begin before the end of the year, with a view to the extended system opening in 2014.== Sources == 
[[Sheffield tram-train project back on the rails]]An ambitious project to bring a unique {w|tram-train} service to {w|Sheffield} and {w|Rotherham}, in the United Kingdom, is back on track, following the announcement of a {w|Pound sterling|?}150,000 {w|Government of the United Kingdom|Government} grant on Thursday. The plans, which were originally to see tram-train operation on a trial basis over the {w|Penistone_Line#Tram-trains_trial|Penistone line} during 2010, have been on the cards since 2008, but were shelved during 2009 to allow alternative proposals to be drawn up. The current plans will now see the vehicles operating along a currently-freight-only line between Rotherham and {w|Meadowhall_Interchange|Meadowhall}, before linking up with the existing {w|South Yorkshire Supertram} network there and continuing onto the streets of Sheffield.The plans to use tram-trains ¡ª which are already in widespread use throughout continental Europe, but not at all within the UK ¡ª have come about as an alternative to an original proposal to extend the Supertram network to Rotherham, which would be a much larger expense for the same or even fewer benefits.Whilst the journey between Sheffield and Rotherham is already covered by mainline trains, project officials believe that the new service ¨C running via Meadowhall South and {w|Rotherham_Central_railway_station|Rotherham Central} and terminating at Parkgate, with a twenty-minute headway throughout ¨C will attract extra custom to the intermediate points between the two conurbations, as well as making travel easier for people who find it hard to walk to and from {w|Sheffield station|Sheffield's railway station}; the tram-trains will serve the heart of the city-centre.Now that the funding for further feasibility work has been approved, {w|Network Rail}, {w|Northern Rail} and the {w|South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive} can continue to look at the business and project case for the trial, which will look at a range of issues, including economic and environmental benefits of the tram-trains, and ensuring that the vehicles will be safe to run on both the Supertram network and heavy rail tracks.Transport Minister {w|Norman Baker} announced the sum, and stressed the Government¡¯s commitment to the scheme: ¡°There is no doubt about finance being available to deliver the scheme. The Government is committed to a trial of tram-trains in the UK and the route between Sheffield and Rotherham is the best place to develop it. This is a unique scheme."Tram-trains offer passengers travelling from rural and suburban areas into city centres a viable, environmentally sound alternative to short and medium car commuting that can cut congestion and reduce overcrowding at railway stations.¡°These sorts of rail fleets are already in use on the continent, but this is a first for the UK. The funding we are providing for this exciting project represents a real chance for us to test whether they can be adapted successfully for South Yorkshire and the rest of the UK."David Brown, director of SYPTE, added: ¡°We have done an awful lot of work on the plans so far and further efforts will look at ensuring the vehicles are compatible with both types of network, which are the same gauge.¡±If further investigations are successful, the system could be up and running by 2014.== Sources == 
[[British music royalties suffer first ever decrease]]In the United Kingdom, {w|PRS for Music} has announced that the total {w|Royalties|royalties} that artists in the music industry receive has decreased by 1%. This is the first time that such a decline has ever occurred.The company has reported that the total was {w|Pound sterling|?}611.2 million in 2010, a decrease of overall annual revenue of 1%, or ?7 million, from 2009. PRS for Music has claimed that this fall was due to lower sales of {w|Compact Disc|Compact Discs} and {w|DVD|DVDs}, as well as digital {w|Copyright infringement|copyright infringement}.The collection society, which is a representation of seventy-five thousand writers, composers and publishers of music, gathers royalties from music being used in excess of twenty-five billion times annually by various means, including television / radio, commercial businesses, musical venues, Compact Discs and DVDs.Robert Ashcroft is the {w|Chief Executive Officer} of PRS for Music and is responsible for being the representative of such British music artists as {w|Adele|Adele}, {w|Jessie J} and {w|Florence and the Machine|Florence Welch}. Speaking about this news, Ashcroft said: "The loss of high street outlets, the slowdown in physical music sales as well as the challenges capturing the full value of music usage online has meant that for the first time we have seen royalties collected dip. Previously, any reduction from falling physical sales had been offset by our strong performance in music licensing both in the UK and internationally. In 2010 slower growth at home and abroad failed to fully mitigate the decline."In 2010, the sales of music physically and digitally grew by 7% to achieve 120 million units. Meanwhile, sales of compact discs fell by 12.4% to a total of 98.5 million. British global entertainment retail chain {w|HMV Group|HMV} has attempted to save money by closing down sixty of its shops in the UK. In 2010, royalties' growth reduced in speed to 4.3%.Simon Neil, of Scottish {w|Rock music|rock} group {w|Biffy Clyro}, explained that "[t]he thing about PRS is for a lot of bands it's the only way you make money. In our first six years of being in a band that was the only kind of income we had. It's the bread and butter for bands. It's almost your only guaranteed source of income."PRS for Music has stated that its payout to its members was decreased by ?800,000, due to improved society efficiency and a reduction in costs related to administration. According to {w|Newsbeat}, the small royalty drop may trigger a larger decline, causing new musical composers and writers to avoid joining the music industry. The company believes that further action needs to be taken to prevent the lack of CD sales and compete with illegal downloads, including the development of legal download services.== Sources == 
[[New York City disputes 2010 Census]]New York City officials plan to dispute the Census Bureau's data, after it was discovered that the 2010 Census reported only minimal growth in New York City and in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. On Sunday, NYC mayor {w|Michael Bloomberg} stated "[t]hat can't be possible," and announced that the city would formally challenge the bureau's findings. NY Senators {w|Kirsten Gillibrand} and {w|Charles Schumer} also expressed interest in the alleged error."These are high growth areas w/large immigrant populations. It's crucial that #NYC get the federal funds & the representation it deserves." said Sen. Gillibrand on her Twitter page. Sen. Schumer, a resident from Brooklyn, also complained, "The Census Bureau has never known how to count urban populations and needs to go back to the drawing board," he said in a statement. "It strains credulity to believe that New York City has grown by only 167,000 people over the last decade. To claim that growth over the last decade in Brooklyn was 1.6% and growth in Queens was 0.1% flies in the face of reality."In order for the city to challenge the count, city officials will contact Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, and will undergo a process known as the Count Question Resolution Program.== Sources == 
[[Explosion at Yemen weapons factory kills dozens]]An explosion at a weapons factory in Yemen killed dozens of people yesterday. According to estimates, over one hundred people may have died in the blast.According to the BBC, at least 78 people were killed, while {w|The Independent} reported that over one hundred people had been killed. The explosion occurred in the southern town of {w|Ja`ar}, located in the province of Abyan.Local media reported that forces loyal to {w|Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|Al-Qaeda} had raided the factory on Sunday. They added that residents were forced to gather supplies from the factory, when a cigarette reportedly triggered the explosion.State news agency {w|Saba News Agency|Saba} said that militants had "seized the factory on Sunday and pushed citizens to [loot] its contents, which led to inflaming of gunpowder and explosives in the factory."A local doctor said that "[t]his accident is a true catastrophe, the first of its kind in Abyan. There are so many burned bodies. I can't even describe the situation." An accurate death toll is reportedly difficult to ascertain due to the condition of bodies, many of which have severe burns.== Sources == 
[[Forces loyal to Ouattara plan to seal Ivory Coast border]]After a battle for the Ivory Coast town of {w|Duekoue}, armed forces loyal to president-elect Alassane Ouattara have announced an effort to seal the border between the Ivory Coast and Liberia.On Monday, Ouattara forces, dubbed {w|Forces Nouvelles de C?te d'Ivoire|New Forces}, and those loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, who claims to be the winner of a disputed election last fall, began fighting in Duekoue, a western town of strategic importance due to its position at a crossroads, with access to both Liberia and Guinea.According to a spokesperson for Ouattara, Seydou Ouattara, the New Forces won the battle, the latest in a series of settlements they have taken control of in recent weeks, and have moved south towards the town of Guiglo.The New Forces also announced they plan to seal the Ivory Coast¡ªLiberia border, as Gbagbo is accused of importing Liberians to fight in his forces. Spokesperson Ouattara said that "[t]oday's operation will prevent Gbagbo from recruiting and training Liberians as he has been doing."According to the United Nations, around 460 people have died in violence since the disputed elections, and another million have left the country.== Sources ==

[[Gaddafi loyalists go on offensive, rebels pushed back]]Troops loyal to Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi launched an offensive Tuesday and managed to push rebel forces out of the town of {w|Bin Jawad}. This comes as world powers met the same day to discuss the future of the country.Rebels disclosed that their troops in Bin Jawad came under heavy artillery and rocket fire, after which they made a hasty retreat. Rebels who were still in the open desert sought cover and fired at Gaddafi troops as they appeared. One rebel warrior said that the shelling was too much for them to handle, A rebel fighter, Ashraf Mohammed, was quoted by Reuters as saying, "[t]he Gaddafi guys hit us with Grads [rockets] and they came round our flanks."Rebel forces retreated to the city of {w|Ras Lanuf}, which they had captured days before on Sunday, where they recuperated. However, they were not completely safe there as they came under heavy gunfire at the western fringe of town and had to defend themselves with any weapons that they could find. Civilians also retreated from the war zone.  One man criticized rebel troops, telling them to "[g]et yourselves up there and stop posing for pictures." Today's battle marked a shift of momentum in favour of government troops; earlier this week rebels held the advantage over pro-Gaddafi forces as they made their westward march with little to no resistance. == Sources == 
[[BP lose laptop containing sensitive claimant data]]Oil company BP has reportedly lost a laptop containing the personal information of approximately 13,000 people who filed claims against the company following the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year.Tom Mueller, a spokesperson for the company, confirmed they had written to "individuals impacted by this event to inform them about the loss of their personal data and to offer them free credit monitoring services to help protect their personal information." Mueller said the laptop was lost during "routine business travel," and was reported to have the ability to be deactivated remotely.BP refused to comment about the employee who lost the laptop. The data on the laptop contained the names, addresses, {w|Social Security numbers}, phone numbers and the dates of birth of claimants, which was unencrypted even though the laptop itself is protected by a password.The data on the laptop concerned claimants against the company after one of its oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, sending up to 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean, which eventually reached the southern U.S. coastline. One resident affected by the the oil disaster and the lost laptop expressed his outrage at BP when interviewed by {w|NPR}. "It's terrible, I kinda work hard for the things I have," he said. "I wouldn't want somebody with a computer to be able to take it from me. It's very disturbing. It's like another gallon of gas thrown on the fire."== Sources ==

[[US President Obama considering supplying arms to Libyan rebels]]United States {w|President of United States|President} Barack Obama revealed Tuesday that he is considering supplying arms to Libyan rebels, among other things. Obama was quoted as saying, "if we [USA] wanted to get weapons into Libya, we probably could."During an interview with {w|NBC News}, Obama disclosed he is, "not ruling it out. But I'm also not ruling it in. We're still making an assessment partly about what Gaddafi's forces are going to be doing." Obama also informed that he would be willing to negotiate a deal with Gaddafi; however, one clause would involve Gadaffi resigning from the leadership post. Obama does not believe it is time for formal negotiations yet as he does not think Gaddafi has reached the point where he needs a quick way out.Also mentioned in the interview was the strategy being used in Libya. "What we've also done is put Gaddafi back on his heels ¡ª at this point. In addition to maintaining a no-fly zone, protecting civilian populations, we also have political tools, diplomatic tools, sanctions, freezing his assets, all of which continue to tighten the noose."Obama reiterated that same view on {w|ABC News} saying in an interview, "I think what we're seeing is that the circle around Gaddafi understands that the noose is tightening, that their days are probably numbered, and they are going to have to think through what their next steps are."Meanwhile, in an interview with {w|CBS News}, Obama said of the rebels leaders that U.S. officials have met with are "[F]ully vetted, so we have a clear sense of who they are, and so far they're saying the right things, and most of them are professionals, lawyers, doctors, people who appear to be credible."This comes after the {w|NATO} supreme commander, Admiral {w|James G. Stavridis} said there were "flickers" of {w|al-Qaeda} and {w|Hezbollah} in Libya. In response, Obama said on CBS, "[T]hat doesn't mean that all the people, among all the people who opposed Qaddafi, there might not be elements that are unfriendly to the United States and our interests. That's why I think it's important for us not to jump in with both feet."As for the rebels themselves, Mahmoud Shammam, a spokesman for the rebels told the {w|New York Times}, "We ask for political support more than arms, but if we have both, that would be good."== Sources == 
[[All change for Nottingham, England trams as new operator announced]]In a somewhat unexpected turn of events, it emerged on Monday that Arrow Light Rail ¡ª the existing operators of {w|Nottingham}, England's {w|Nottingham Express Transit|Express Transit} system ¡ª were to have their contract ripped up, after the preferred bidder for the construction of Phase 2 was announced. The change means that the entire network will be able to be integrated throughout, rather than having two operators effectively running two separate systems.Tramlink Nottingham chairman Roger Harrison said: "Building on Arrow's successful legacy, we are excited to be taking forward the next chapter in Nottingham's tram story."Our focus now will be on working with Nottingham City Council to ensure NET Phase Two can be introduced at the earliest opportunity."The reshuffle of operating consortium means that {w|Nottingham City Transport} ¡ª the main provider of bus services within Nottingham ¡ª will have no part to play in the extended network, despite the numerous awards and high satisfaction levels NET has had since its opening; it is the only one of Britain's five light rail networks to be an instant success."We're obviously very disappointed not to be part of the selected preferred consortium. Nottingham's tram has won numerous awards and after seven years passengers continue to praise its operation. We would have relished the opportunity to have been part of this continuing success," said NCT's Managing Director Mark Fowles.But the council stresses that they are still committed to the future of the company."This decision in no way reflects the excellent job Arrow Light Rail Limited has done operating the tram since its launch. Annual customer satisfaction figures remain very high and this is testament to this operation," added Jane Todd. "The decision to appoint a new consortium to build and operate the extended tram network was made on the basis of selecting the best proposal to meet the council's objectives for the future of the tram system. The overall offer from the Tramlink Nottingham consortium was stronger. Although disappointing for NCT it is nonetheless good news for the integration of public transport services that the city's other major bus operator, Trent Barton, is part of the preferred bidder. I am certain NCT will continue to provide award winning bus services for the people of Nottingham."Staff currently employed by Arrow Light Rail are expected to be transferred over to Tramlink Nottingham around August, when further details of the contract will become clear. Other changes that are proposed for the network include 'smart card' ticketing ¡ª similar to the highly successful {w|Oyster_card|Oyster} scheme that is in use across {w|Transport for London}'s service ¡ª and the phasing out of tram conductors in favour of on-platform ticketing machines. Current conductors will be offered new roles within the company, though talks are still on-going about how to combat any potential fare-dodgers.Furthermore, an additional 22 tram vehicles will be built by consortium member Alstom for the extended network, though these will be of a different design to the 15 existing vehicles, which were built by {w|Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier} to their {w|AT6/5|Incentro} design for the system's opening. The new trams will be part of Alstom's {w|Alstom Citadis|Citadis} family, and will bring the total tram fleet to 37. This will also allow for service frequencies to be increased and for overcrowding to be eased at peak times.Ticketing arrangements for the network will also change when the new consortium takes over. Currently, combined tickets, cards and passes can be used for the tram and NCT buses, but these are due to be phased out and replaced with the new smart cards in time for the opening of the extensions. Prior to that, passengers will be able to use combined tickets, cards and passes for the tram and Trent Barton buses, in a similar arrangement to that which is already offered for NCT.Pat Armstrong, director for NET, said: "The move is very much towards more sophisticated smart ticketing, like the Oyster card in London. You use the same card but the money goes back to the company you are travelling with."The extended network, new trams and numerous other changes should be fully operational by the end of 2014, but NET users and tramway enthusiasts had mixed views on the matter:"I think it's a bad idea to phase out the conductors," said Andrew Blood, assistant editor of the Tramways Monthly e-magazine, "Not only do they help with revenue protection, but they are also responsible for the high passenger satisfaction levels on the system. In short, they keep tram users feeling safe."Greg Smith, from Hucknall, was pleased that service levels were going to increase: "The fact that the trams will be running more frequently is a massive bonus in my eyes. The service we get at [the Hucknall] end of the line is great already, but if [the trams] are running more frequently it's just another advantage of the system over the bus." But he was also wary of on-platform ticketing being brought into place: "I'm not sure that losing the conductors in favour of ticket machines is the way to go, though."== Sources == 
[[Japanese nuclear officials race to avoid disaster as radiation levels in sea rocket]]Levels of {w|Iodine-131} off the coast of the plant were recorded to be almost 3,400 times the legal limit, the Japanese nuclear safety authority, {w|Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency}, said. The levels of radiation are the highest recorded since the crisis began. Officials are now struggling to find how radiation is leaking from the plant, and have prohibited fishing in the area. A spokesperson for Nisa insisted there was no immediate threat to humans from the leakage into the sea. "We will find out how it happened and do our utmost to prevent [the levels of radiation] from rising," he said.The situation at the nuclear plant is considered dire after the Japanese government accepted an offer of assistance from the United States and France. An experienced nuclear engineer has warned the {w|nuclear reactor core|reactor core} at No. 2 reactor at the plant may have melted. Workers at the plant are battling to cool the reactors and stop further radiation leakage.If the crisis continues to escalate, the {w|Economy of Japan|Japanese economy} could sustain serious damage as fisherman are banned from working in the area of contaminated water. "The worst-case scenario is that this drags on not one month or two months or six months, but for two years, or indefinitely," an analyst, based in Tokyo, said. "Japan will be bypassed. That is the real nightmare scenario." A spokesperson for the Japanese government warned officials "are not yet in a situation" to say when the race to avert the crisis from escalating will end.Masataka Shimizu, the chief executive of Tepco, was transported to hospital with {w|dizziness} and {w|hypertension} as criticism of the company continues to build. Last week, three workers stepped into contaminated cooling water as they tried to replace cables at one of the reactors of the plant and two were hospitalized. The workers have  now been released from the hospital.Tepco has apologized to those affected by the nuclear emergency in a statement released March 18. "We sincerely apologize to all the people living in the surrounding area of the power station and people in Fukushima Prefecture, as well as to the people of society for causing such great concern and nuisance," the company said in the statement. The sale of numerous vegetables grown near the plant has been banned by authorities after they tested positive for radiation. Officials have also warned parents not to give {w|tap water} to infants after it emerged that it may have become contaminated. A large area around the plant has been evacuated.== Sources ==

[[First images received from orbit around Mercury]]The first images of {w|Mercury|Mercury} taken from orbit around the planet have been received from NASA's {w|MESSENGER|MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging probe}. The images come after the spacecraft entered an orbit around the closest planet to the sun on March 17.After various system examinations, the first images from the spacecraft were sent at 0520 {w|Eastern Time Zone|EDT}.Before arriving in orbit around Mercury, the MESSENGER spacecraft was launched in 2004, passed by Mercury twice in 2008 and once more in 2009. MESSENGER is the first artificial satellite to be placed in orbit around Mercury. Because Mercury is the innermost planet in the {w|Solar System}, the sun's gravitational attraction altered the spacecraft's approach to the planet. Because of this, a series of several maneuvers over three years was required to put the probe in orbit.Although MESSENGER is the first probe to enter orbit around Mercury, it is not the first to fly by. {w|Mariner 10} was the first to do this when it made three passes during the 1970s.NASA is continuing to release images taken by the spacecraft as they arrive at Earth. MESSENGER is scheduled to begin it's primary mission on April 4, consisting of various scientific and visual observations of the planet. Some of the scientific goals the probe is to accomplish are: determination of the geologic composition of Mercury, study of the planet's magnetic field and internal composition, and transmission of more than 75,000 images back to Earth.== Sources == 
[[Libyan foreign minister defects to the UK]]Libyan foreign minister {w|Mussa Kussa} has fled to the United Kingdom and has announced that he is no longer willing to work for Muammar Gaddafi's regime.A spokesman for the UK government said Kussa "arrived at {w|Farnborough Airport} on 30 March from Tunisia. He travelled here under his own free will." He added: "Moussa Kussa is one of the most senior figures in Gaddafi's government and his role was to represent the regime internationally¡ªsomething that he is no longer willing to do. We encourage those around Gaddafi to abandon him and embrace a better future for Libya that allows political transition and real reform that meets the aspirations of the Libyan people."Kussa is the highest ranking government official of Libya to defect as of late, and is a blow to Gaddaffi, as his government in recent weeks has been trying to crush rebellions that have sprung-up after a series of protests and revolutions occurred throughout the Middle East, demanding their leaders step down from power.Before the defection, it was reported government forces have recently taken back the port-town of {w|Ras Lanuf} and the nearby town of {w|Bin Jawad}.== Sources ==

Where we're at right now as a discussion has developed originally as a tangent to revisit the age-old problem. A draft is on the table, located here: http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:Tempodivalse/User_interaction_policy [18:10]  Mattisse seems to be having chat trouble, based on on-wiki conversations : [18:14]        Hi [18:15]         Hi Mattise [18:15]        Hi to everyone [18:15]        Mattise: Did you see the conversation that was happening before you joined? [18:15]  yay! Technical problems overcome [18:16]        Yes, I saw it on a web page http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikinews-workshop but there was no way for me to enter in there. [18:16]        ok [18:17]        before I forget, barking fish wanted it noted: [18:17]        [23:19]  Filing note here that I will be unable to attend the meeting set for this time, as I am out tonight to attend a Prison Officers Union meeting. Noting my apologies for the absence. [18:18]  Okay, I'm going to be AFK for a bit. I'll be back before the meeting's out, so feel free to ping questions etc at me if you have any for me specifically and I'll answer on my return. [18:18]        So in my experiance, the be nice or block approach to niceness policies tends not work [18:19]        Using blocks as any form of punishment tends not to work. They're really only effective against vandals whom we don't want to edit the site ever again [18:20]       We could make their articles wait in the queue for hours without a review?..oh, wait, that happens to everyone! Silly me! [18:21]        Whose articles? The vandals? [18:22]         Dendodge: lol [18:22]        I think he meant any contributor deemed not to be nice [18:22]         I agree that blocks aren't the best solution. We need to foster a different atmosphere somehow though [18:22] -->|    Amgine_ has joined #wikinews-workshop [18:22] ||    Amgine_ has joined #wikinews-workshop [18:22]        Deemed by whom? [18:22]         It amazes me that some users can't seem to acknowledge that incivility is harmful [18:22]        I don't think dendodge's suggestion was serious [18:23]       It wasn't. It was satirical. [18:23]       Kind of on-topic, I thought, but I'll shut up if you disagree. [18:25]        Well, my nickname is Mattisse but I accidentally entered it as Mattise the first time. I think I will have to shut down the whole chat to make the change. Then I would lose all that has been said so far. [18:25]        Mattise you can change your nickname [18:25]        by doing [18:25]        /nick new name [18:26]        I have done that. But it only takes effect if I close chat. Then I would lose the preceding conversation, I think. [18:26]        Also the contents of this chat are going to be posted on wiki afterwards [18:26] =-=     YOU are now known as itShouldTakeAffe [18:26] =-=     YOU are now known as bawolff [18:26]        It should take affect immediatly [18:26]        No worries: I don't think the nick is as important as knowing who is whom. [18:27]        yes [18:27]        That's great but I wouldn't being participating then. [18:28] -->|    phearson has joined #wikinews-workshop [18:28]       Hello [18:29]        What is the nick command? The place on the web cat that says change nickname only carries through with the change if I close web chat and then restart it. [18:29]       /nick [18:29] |<--    Tempo_away has left freenode [18:29]        Mattise, in any case we know who you are, thats what is important in the end [18:30]        OK , I tried the /nick command but, as you can see, it did not work. I would have to shut down chat and restart it to have the name change take effect. [18:31] ===     Mattise  ?..New Now Know How?.. [18:31] ===     Mattise: member of #wikinews-workshop [18:31] ===     Mattise: attached to lindbohm.freenode.net ?..Stockholm, Sweden?.. [18:31] ---     End of WHOIS information for Mattise. [18:32]        Mattise: since you're using chatzilla, you know how right beside of the box where you type stuff, there is a box containing your name. If you click on that, there should be a drop down with an option to change name [18:32] -->|    brianmc-phone has joined #wikinews-workshop [18:32]        I acknowledge that incivility is harmful. [18:32]         sigh, IRC is really not new user friendly is it? [18:32] [18:32]        hi brianmc-phone [18:32]  Nowhere near as bad as nntp:// [18:32]         [18:33]        So brianmc-phone I imagine has some interesting thoughts on the relative harmfulness of civility? [18:33]        Yes, there is a drop down box for changing my name. However, the name change only takes effect if I close web chat and then restart it. I would lose the previous conversation if I did that. [18:33]  Which, curiously, doesn't cite an author. [18:34]  Yes, but many of my thoughts on civility are generally considered deeply offensive. [18:34]        Isn't one of the problems that incivility is not defined? Different users have different definitions. [18:35]       Mattise: what IRC cleint are you using? [18:35]        Do you really think its possible to make a definition [18:35] ===     CTCP version reply ?..ChatZilla 0.9.86.1 [Firefox 4.0/20110318052756]?.. from Mattise [18:35]        phearson: he's using chatzilla [18:36]       thats strange [18:36]        what is civility depends a lot on context [18:36]        My view, which seems to be supported by few people, is that wiki projects are work places and work place civility should pertain. [18:36]        Incivility is contextual, and so is effectively undefinable. [18:36]  Let me start with this, relatively inoffensive, one: Setting up an IRC channel, pushing for discussion in said, then announcing you can't attend is offensive. [18:36]       Ive used chatzilla in the past, and its always changed for me. [18:37]        Well, what can I say? It doesn't for me. [18:37]        brianmc-phone: Well that may be true, Tempo not being here is a bit off-topic... [18:38]         Mattise: there appears to be a "Mattisse" in channel as well. Do you still have the browser chat open? [18:38]  I qas discussing whether or not this channel, and discussion herein, might be productive less than 48hrs ago. Where is the proposer who dumped us in here for an 'online cage fight'? [18:39]        Brianmc-phone: fruitless line of discussion. [18:39] -->|    ashershow1 has joined #wikinews-workshop [18:39]     hey guys [18:39]         Hi ashershow1 :) [18:39]        Hi ashershow1 [18:39]     wub! [18:39]     glad to see you back :) [18:40]     so what's the topic? [18:40] -->|    AutisticPsycho has joined #wikinews-workshop [18:40]        My specific problem, as everyone knows, took place in the context of a review. I think if there were clear guidelines for what should be discussed in a review, it would have helped. [18:41]  Amgine_, I disagree that highlighting apparently being set up to fail is unproductive. [18:42]        I don't still have the web page open [18:42]        The issue at hand is Wikinews. Not if this chat is a good/bad idea. [18:42]     I think the review process should be confined to just plagiarism and fact-checking review. thoughts? [18:42]        I'd consider those the hard parts [18:43]        plagerism and fact-cheking takes 99.9% of the time [18:43]  Fair enough. Then moving on from this being 'sprung on everyone', I'd highlight geoff's submission and the teain wreck that was. [18:43]        The rest of it is generally easy in my mind [18:43]         Yeah, that's how I remember it too [18:44]        Agree, and such things as spelling, grammar, bad phrasing, etc. The article should be presentable as in a newspaper. [18:44]  First off, submission for review isn't an appeal for assistance. [18:45]     spelling, grammar, and bad phrasing can all be fixed after the article is published [18:45]  No. [18:45]        Everything can be fixed after an article is published for some sense of fixed [18:45]        No, but if the article has spelling, dramatical errors and is badly worded, it should not be passed. [18:46]  But not as archived by google, or viewed by all social media followers [18:46]         An article should meet minimal English. [18:46]         or if minor, they can be fixed by the reviewer of course [18:46]        Tweaks can be made after publication, but I think it should be basically presentable at the time of publication. [18:46]  Yes, thewub [18:46]        Someone should be able to look at it and understand it is a news story. [18:47]  My standards are probably too high... [18:47]        BUT: I don't think an article should be unduly delayed, either. It can always be unpublished, too. [18:47]     yes, obviously the article should be generally well-written, but I find a lot of my reviewing time is spent rewording and correcting grammar [18:47]        Oh, hey, bawolff... what's the status of 21919? [18:48]  If you're not thinking GA equivalent of WP, you're asking for a fail from a time-pressed reviewer [18:48]        Its pending further review/comments from somebody else [18:48]        But I think emotional reactions, lectures on article writing, what an "editor" is in the real world are out of place [18:48]  Eh? [18:48]        Bawolff: 28 hours and brion is on payroll. [18:49]        That is how I experienced the review I am referring to. I haven't had problems with other reviews. [18:49]        brianmc-phone: Bawolff and I are talking about getting the ability to "unpublish" on Google News for en.WN. [18:50]  GNSM? [18:50]         [18:50]        Mattise, lectures may not be appropriate, but surely if someone fails an article, you'd want them to tell you why [18:50] * bawolff       is uncertain if GNSM would actually allow unpublish [18:50]  I fully trust Brion to kick ass and sort that. [18:51]         Even if we had the option to unpublish, it's not something I'd like to see being used often [18:51]  Agreed. [18:52]        Anyway, because I was confused and kept asking for clarification, and because the review veered into discussion of whether I had a "different" idea of what an editor was [18:57]  Lol. [18:58]        I asked for specific criticisms instead of general ones. I was told I was being unreasonable and given lectures on article writing it was suggested that I consult BBC and Al Jezeera first. Well, I had already consulted those sources. These comments and others, that the article was "poetic POV" when the reviewer had not consulted the sources. I think before the third "fail" he did consult them. [18:58]        Mattise: How many articles have you had published? [18:58]        I wish those review pages had not been deleted so I could see what happened. [18:59]        They can be recovered. How many articles have you had published? [18:59]         Yes. [18:59]         Deleted does not mean gone permeantly. [18:59]        I have published 34 and 1/2 articles [18:59]         Everything is stored... forever. [19:00]         DUN DUN DUN [19:00]  In a server far, far away... [19:00]         Mattise raises a good point though. We have useful feedback in the review templates/article talk, and then it gets deleted. Should make a point of at least copying to the user's talk page [19:01]        Mattise: so, this one article you've had trouble with accounts for 3% of the articles you have done, roughly. How important is this one event to your en.WN experience? [19:01]         WTF? [19:01] * AutisticPsycho        facepalms [19:01]         brb [19:01]         fixing something [19:02]        Well, I am not interested in doing bad things. But I have never experienced a review like that one. The reviewer seemed overly involved to me, and overly emotional. I admit I did not take this well. [19:03]         Who was said reviewer [19:03]        Mattise, is Talk:Libyan leader says to nation: 'I will die a martyr' the page in question [19:03]  I've fought over a single word... [19:03]         However, do you admit that you have taken this one event, a relatively small amount of your experience, and focused on it to the exclusion of the 97% of your experience which has been without issues? [19:03]        But if I can be offered constructive criticism regarding that review, and shown where I went wrong, I would welcome it. [19:03] * AutisticPsycho        sharpens and polishes banhammer [19:03] * AutisticPsycho        grins evily [19:03]        AutisticPsycho: I believe it was pi zero who Mattise got in a disagreement with [19:04]         Ah. [19:04]        No, I think xe had an issue with Pi Zero, which led to an issue with BarkingFish. [19:04] -->|    Nemo_bis has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:04]         Speaking of issues. [19:04]         [19:04]        well yes, but BarkingFish was not the reviewer of said article if i recall [19:05]         What's everyone's take on my little incident with Nascar? [19:05]       hi Amgine_ [19:05]  One point has to be clear: [19:05]  News automatically carries a risk of contributor conflict. [19:05]        I have read over the talk page conversations in the reviewers archives, where I tried to express myself but I still don't quite understand what happened. [19:05]        Haven't seen it, AutisticPsycho. [19:05]        Mattise, I remember reading some of that a while back. I think a large amount of that was miscommunication. I think both parties thought people were saying things different from what they actually were intending [19:06]        WN:WYSINYM and all [19:06]        Mattise: In my experiences on en.WN mis-communication is nearly always the issue. [19:06]         http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews:RFP#TUFKAAP_.28talk_.C2.B7_contribs.29_.E2.80.94_reconfirmation [19:06]         My take and all. [19:07]         More or less... I was on IRC. [19:07]         [19:07]         Nascar was being a bit rude. [19:07]        bawolff: wth? [19:07]        AutisticPsycho: personally I would have preferred that any action taken against Nascar for that stayed in irc, but overall I don't think you were really out of line [19:08]         Flooding spam from wikilinker... depsite requests to tell him to stop. [19:08]         Yes. [19:08]        Amgine_: WYSINYM - what you see is not what you mean - the article explains it perfectly ;) [19:08]         It should have. I just wanted to knock him down a peg temporarily. [19:08]         Apolgize for being an ass. [19:08]         Making racist comments to diego. [19:09]        My problem with that was how it happened. A few editors one evening decided on IRC that Nascar should be blocked. I thought such procedures should be transparent. I felt very bad for Nascar. [19:09]        bawolff: You forgot a letter. [19:09]         And homophobic comments to someone else that caused a contributor to cry. [19:09]  bawolff, I had that issue with text messages between myself and the woman I'm "courting" [19:09]         Mattise: I never planned on blocking him. [19:10]         I was going to remove his reviewing rights temporarily and have him apolgize to return them. [19:10]        WN:WYSINYM - don't know what that is. Another disadvantage for newbies is most of the conversations are in jargon. [19:10]        Mattise: sorry, should have had an extra W in there - https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikinews/en/wiki/Wikinews:WYSINWYM [19:10]        Mattise: I was not in IRC at the time, or I would have acted to prevent it from escalating the way it did. In some respects I agree with you. However, I also have to say that *after events escalated* Nascar did xyurself considerable injury by baiting and instigating problems. [19:11]  What you Say Is Not What Others Think You Mean... [19:11]         AutisticPsycho: I don't think anyone's defending his actions. But as I said in your Reconf request, rights changes really ought to be discussed on wiki except in the most extreme cases [19:11]        Mattise: and further more, I made it up ten minutes ago, so you're not alone in not knowing what it means :) [19:11]        WN:WYSINYM doesn't turn up in "search". [19:11]  We shouldn't be using abbreviated links when we know the bot to link them isn't working, bawolff [19:11]        Mattise: yes, I made a typo, extra W between N and Y [19:12] [19:12]         Yes. [19:12]         Oh well. [19:12]         Guess I won't apply for Oversight then. [19:12]         : [19:26]         Now. Thats how I view ENWP [19:26]         It's too big for itself in some ways. [19:27]  Well, ignoring Mattisse's specific incident, we still have a more general problem. Drama is simply more noticeable owing to the smaller community. However, that small community gives us a chance to become a better community - something WP may never do owing to the difficulty of changing something so big. [19:27]        The two projects are hardly comparable; and I don't think en.WP is particularly relevant for this discussion. [19:27]         Agree, BRS. [19:27]        The incident with my review was in the very beginning. That one incident did not color my view as I stayed and wrote 34 articles. I am talking about what I am perceiving recently, and not about stuff that pertains to me personally. It is how I see others treated. [19:27]         AutisticPsycho: I'd say it's the opposite of chaos theory. enWP could have a hurricane happen to it, but you'd never get consensus for the butterfly to flap its wings [19:28]         I do think the hostility to Wikipedia and "not invented here" syndrome on Wikinews is hurting us though. [19:28]  Nice analogy [19:28] -->|    Bobby122 has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:28]        hi Bobby122 [19:28]        thewub: I agree [19:29]       Hi [19:29]         Like it or not WP is massively successful, and has a huge pool of potential clued up users for us [19:29]        I think there are many things at Wikipedia that are not appropriate for us [19:29] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:29]        But we shouldn't reject things out of hand because Wikipedia does it [19:29]        Hi diego [19:29]        As I said, what happened to me is immaterial. It is not the reason that I feel as I do about the atmosphere here. And I don't see the relevance of discussing wikipedia here. [19:29]  Wikipedia contributors arrive with so much passive voice you risk a coma. :p [19:29]         bawolff: precisely [19:29]         Mattise: Well, the recent incident with me is a rarity. [19:29]    hi bawolff [19:29]         I'm a nice guy and I hardly take action. [19:29]         I usually don't ban people. [19:30]         And the stuff I delete are stale articles, spam and copyvios. [19:32]        "Like it or not WP is massively successful, and has a huge pool of potential clued up users for us". I agree and I think many users would be attracted to this site as it is much easier to produce material here then on WP. But no. Something drives people off. [19:32]  Wikinews has far more extremes; can any one contributor claim main authorship on 5% of the FAs - as can two in this discussion? [19:33]  Wikinews has a steep learning curve. Some Wikipedians may well find that they are more likely to get past that learning curve than total newcomers to wikis. [19:33]         Mattise: actually I think it's much harder on Wikinews because of the time pressures. But the reward of having a lasting permanent article is greater, and would probably appeal to certain WPians [19:34] -->|    Tyrol5 has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:34]  Hi Tyrol5 [19:34]         Hey! [19:35]        Gotta run, will be in and out. [19:35]        The learning curve is steep because it is so hard to find anything out about the site. But writing an article here is basically the same as writing one on WP, except that the standards are lower, comprehensiveness etc isn't addressed, there is not much of an MOS. The articles are short. Much easier I think, than WP. [19:35]  Of whom? :p [19:36]  What would be very cool is if we took small groups of Wikipedians for an intensive crash-course led by experienced Wikinewsies. All the basics are there, it's just a question of getting used to news style and a few weird requirements that means. [19:36] [19:36] [INFO]  2 matches for ?..Mattis?..: [Mattise, Mattisse] [19:36]  I'd favour that [19:37]        Mattise: otoh, here it has to all be done at the moment, which is harder then wikipedia which is much more eventualist [19:37]  Mattise: Yes, I actually find comprehensive encyclopedic coverage harder to do - and I have done it. [19:38]        But the "news style" is very easy to learn. Much easier than learning to write a WP article. Editors that don't have a chance of writing a decent WP article can write a publishable one here. On WP, people spend months, even years on the same article. [19:38]         I personally didn't notice too steep of a learning curve between WP and WN. Although my very first visit to WN was a bit intimidating. [19:38]         someone suggested getting WP Wikiprojects involved. I think that could work really well, as it gives them an outlet for stuff they have interest in, but can't put on WP [19:39]    Tyrol5: I concur [19:39]        Agree with Tyrol5 to a T. [19:39]    My first 3 articles were deleted, and only the one I did with very little original reporting was eventually published five days after the event [19:40]         Mattise: exactly, people can afford to spend ages on a WP article. And they have loads of specialists who polish certain areas e.g. images, refs. We can't afford that [19:40]  If you can get people who'll do a pre-review submission in a timely manner, or very detailed failing reviews, yes. [19:40]    I struggled with myself trying to write those articles, my English was very rusty by then [19:40]         Why can we recruit from the Signpost? [19:40]   As an experienced Wikinewsie who predates things like the review process, I find that trying to explain things to confused newcomers is all the harder because I'm so used to it. Obviously, that's not good. [19:41]  Yep. [19:41]        The editors who reviewed my articles didn't seem to find it hard and they were quick. [19:41]         Making from switch from WP Signpost to Wikinews wouldnt be hard all. [19:42]  We've quite a history of enWP misfits landing on their feet. [19:43]        That's not a compliment from my point of view. [19:43]  Why not? [19:43]  Mattise: Well, that's very good to hear - because I do fear we lose people because we can't explain clearly why we keep failing reviews. [19:43]        AutisticPsycho: my previous experiance with some of the signpost editors have been less then positive [19:43]        I mean " Making from switch from WP Signpost to Wikinews wouldnt be hard all." is not a compliment. [19:44]  People try an article, fail to resolve issues in time for it to still be news, move on and get more success. [19:44]  Some do. Some just give up as far as I can tell [19:45] -->|    BarkingFish has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:45]        Hi BarkingFish [19:45]    Hi bawolff :) [19:45]        I see you made it after all [19:45]        When I first started I was surprised to learn that the "Collaboration" page isn't really for collaboration at all. Maybe real collaboration should be encouraged. [19:45]    Evening all. I wasn't supposed to be here, but since I got back from my meeting, I figured to pop in and see what was going on :) [19:46]   Well, collaboration is certainly okay on there - not that we really get much [19:46]  Evening, Fish [19:46]         bawolff: How so? [19:46]  There's the apparent assumption you can spend an indeterminite tome fiddling towards acceptable; other people are relieved to get it zapped and start over having, hopefully, learned something. [19:46]    hi B-R-S [19:46]        AutisticPsycho: in reference to signpost editors? [19:47] -->|    gopher65 has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:47]        AutisticPsycho, I don't know who you are or what your recent incident is. [19:47]        MAttise, AutisticPsycho is TUFKAAP [19:47] [19:47]        OH!!! [19:48]  One of many Wikinewsies who has paperwork to prove they're sane ;) [19:49]        Collaboration is the heart and soul of WP. Perhaps that accounts for its relative success. [19:49]        Wikis do tend to work best when the work can be split up [19:49]        so people only do the part they "like" [19:50]        I often wonder why people don't jump in and help a newbie out with his article. [19:50]  That should definitely happen more. [19:50]         Yeah, collaboration on the article scale is tough on Wikinews because of time pressure, edit conflicts [19:50]         bawolff: yes in reference to Singpost. [19:50]       We tend to let people get on with it. I'm not sure why, it's just the way the community developed. [19:50]       I'd like to once again bring up the realtime editor that a few of us were working with a few months ago: Piratepad. It worked great for collabrative editing. I'd like to see the use of such an editor either built into to Mediawiki, or the use of something like piratepad offical encouraged. [19:50]        Help in the education and explaining, and help the newbie achieve some success. [19:50]         I actually did got a good bit of help with my first article last July [19:50]       I've been asking for more collaboaration for a while. [19:50]       http://piratepad.net/wikinews [19:51]         Mattise: Yes, I'm TUFKAAP. Guess I should have told you. My bad. ^_^; [19:51]  Wikinews is more individualistic. Smaller contrib base leaves less interest overlap. [19:51]       Microchip and I wrote an experimental article on that a while ago, and it worked awesome [19:51]    The most collaboration I've seen tends to occur when a story breaks in another language, and contact is sought from other language projects. [19:51]         gopher65: Would definitley like to try that. A few of us were on Google Wave once, but I don't think anything much got done there [19:52]       It's fun. [19:52]    I saw it happen with a story I filed nearly 2 or 3 years ago, the German "double arm" transplant case, which got collaboration from de.wikinews [19:52]         Cuz Google Wave sucked? [19:52]    gopher65: that's nice [19:52]        gopher65: you and half the world would like to see etherpad integrated into mediawiki [19:52]  Tyrol5: Would you say getting helped early on played a big part in you deciding to stay? [19:52]        but it'd be complicated [19:52]       Everyone go to that piratepad link that I linked. [19:52]       Let's play for jsut a minute so everyone can see what it's like when a bunch of people are on at once [19:53]         BRS: Definately, yes. I was pretty confused about the review process, and the help definitely played a large role [19:53]        I am interested in about any subject. There are a few that I am just not capable of being helpful for, but mostly I enjoy the putting together of an article, regardless of topic. And if I don't know much about the subject originally, I will by the time the article is written. [19:53]    link please, gopher65? [19:53]         http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google_to_discontinue_social_networking_application_Google_Wave [19:53]       http://piratepad.net/wikinews [19:53]         Speaking of Google Wave [19:53]         missing picture [19:53]         ARGH [19:53]        AutisticPsycho: Well its probably only one editor, the rest are probably nicer. But one of them told me I was supporting an evil dictator and put a picture of a hanging guy on my talk page... [19:54]         brb, need to restart firefox [19:54] |<--    thewub has left freenode [19:54]        although to be honest, that was probably more directed to brianmc then me... [19:56] -->|    thewub has joined #wikinews-workshop [19:56]  Mattise: This might seem a bit random, but why did you come to Wikinews in the first place? I ask because you were one of a sudden surge of much-needed new editors and I wondered if there was something in particular brought them all to the project [19:58] |<--    Dendodge has left freenode [19:58]       Yeah, like a linkie from another site? [19:58]       Or a blog? [19:59] |<--    diego has left freenode [19:59] |<--    Bobby122 has left freenode [19:59]        I really don't know. I always ignored the site and rarely if ever visited it. Recently I have been visiting a lot of sites that I never gave the time of day to before. I can't even remember what prompted me to write my first article. But despite having my first article merged and my second one deleted, I saw very quickly that it wasn't that hard to write an article. [20:00]         bawolff: LOL WTF? [20:01] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [20:01]  Thanks for the reply, interesting [20:01]  Okay... It's just after midnight in my timezone, so I'm off to bed. [20:01]        AutisticPsycho: well there was a back story. There was a dispute. I supported a block by brianmc that was very questionable, etc [20:02]         ah. [20:02]         'night BRS [20:02]      The meeting is over, according to the clock. [20:02]         Night. [20:02]         It is. [20:02]         I say we keep going though. [20:02]      That should be fine. [20:03]        I enjoy copy editing too. But the "atmosphere" quickly started to get me down. So I just kept my head down and tried to stay out of things. But the fact that the community is so small, so everyone reads everyone else's talk page and feels free to but in with whatever comment they feel like making, means that it is hard to be quiet and do your own thing here. [20:03] [20:03]       http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/wikinews/hVGl0qI994 [20:03]       Here's the article we wrote before [20:04]       Just to give you an idea of how it ended up looking by the time we were finished [20:04]         it just crashed... [20:04]       It was a short little thing, but that was just as an example [20:04] |<--    B-R-S has left freenode [20:04]       Yeah, it did [20:04]       Maybe it can't handle 8 connections at once;) [20:04]         Heh. [20:05]         I noticed you can choose a lisence in the toolbar. [20:05] |<--    diego has left freenode [20:05]        Mattise, I think the quiet and do your own thing tends not to work. I'm fairly sure that most of the comments were not meant as unfriendly. When one person thinks something is unfriendly, but the commenter has no idea his comment came off as unfriendly, its not a good situation [20:05] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [20:05]       That's also why it's probably a good idea to copy/paste it to wikinews on a regular basis [20:05]        Thus quiet do your own thing just keeps the problem there, since the people causing the problem don't realize what they're doing [20:05]    gopher65: We'd be better using a proper etherpad. Fundraising had over 30 people on in one go regularly [20:06]        It would be wonderful if wikinews could provide that kind of pleasure. I feel like it has the potential. But that means that the "old guard" has to be willing to allow changes. [20:06]    their servers would probably handle the load better [20:06]       What's a proper one? [20:06]  BarkingFish: The "proper one" closed a year or so ago. [20:06] * gopher65      <-------- doesn't know anything about etherpads [20:06]    Bleep:??? We were only using it in January... [20:06]    Dang [20:06]         brb [20:06]         gopher65: The software is open source, you can installed on your own server [20:07]         https://github.com/ether/pad [20:07]  The software is open source, though, and we could easily run our own version of the software... perhaps on Wikinewsie [20:07]        Mattise: I first experimented with multi-editor interfaces for en.WN in 2005; we've been looking at the possibility for a long time. [20:07]  BarkingFish: http://etherpad.com/ [20:07]       Yeah, I was thinking Wikinewsie too [20:07]        yeah, Wikimedia has a copy they use for internal stuff [20:07]  BarkingFish: There's numerous "etherpads", but there's no "proper etherpad" any more. [20:07]  Pirate Pad is just one of many. [20:10]    bawolff: That's the one we were using. [20:10]  The only trouble with the software is that it's quite resource intensive, from experience. [20:10] * Bleep runs an install on his server cluster. [20:10]        Server side is not an issue. Bandwidth is the concern I have. [20:10]    I've used iEtherPad before, that's usually pretty stable [20:10]    http://ietherpad.com/wikinews [20:10]       Are we allowed to use that internal wikimedia one? [20:10]       Or is that for offical work only [20:10]       ? [20:10]        I think it's a big maybe, gopher65. [20:10]        But time to take this load. Back in a couple hours. [20:10]         Philippe is probably best person to ask [20:10]    thewub: When you can find Philippe online that is. I've not seen M. Beaudette for some considerable time. [20:10]    Last I saw of him online was an hour before he disappeared off on vacation about 8 or 9 weeks ago [20:11]       He seems like he's been a bit overworked for the past while. [20:11]      You could always try his email. [20:11]        Bleep, I can imagine etherpad being quite resource intensive [20:11]         We could toss it on wikinewsie.org [20:11]         If brianmc doesnt mind [20:11]       What is our monthly bandwidth allowance on Wikinewsie? Or is there one? [20:11]         BarkingFish: Heh, I emailed him about a month ago. He replied back within 5 mins despite being "on vacation" :) [20:11]        brianmc-phone: Is there any issues with running a Scala app on wikinewsie.org ? [20:12]         It seems you can create public pads on eiximenis... so I dunno. [20:12]       I'll email him [20:12]         The pad I just created said: [20:13]         Please use this tool for public information only, and post notes to a public wiki when you're done. [20:13]        AutisticPsycho: its sometimes used by devs to plan stuff I know [20:13]  bawolff: I only tend to have ~3 users on mine at any one time, and it just hogs. [20:15]         bawolff: Heh. [20:16]        Bleep, I've been meaning to try out an install on my computer, but havn't gotten around to compiling/installing scala/whatever it needs [20:16]        Question to bawolff; "Thus quiet do your own thing just keeps the problem there, since the people causing the problem don't realize what they're doing" But what to do. Trying to interact with them usually brings on more grief. [20:17]  bawolff: The only reason I persist with it is that it's kinda crucial to my e-mag - without it our entire planning process would go to pot! [20:18]        Mattise: Thats a good point. Unfortunately I don't have a good answer. [20:18]       Ok, email sent. [20:21]       http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/wikinews/hVGl0qI994 [20:21]       Ok, piratepad is back up [20:21]       There is the article we wrote before [20:21]       As an example [20:21]       That might not be the final revions [20:21]       *revision [20:21]       I think we did a bit more onwiki after we left [20:21]         So what else should we talk about... [20:21]      I don't know if anyone asked yet, but did using PiratePad work out well? [20:21]         I feel it did. [20:21]         With our little test. [20:21]       Yup [20:21]       It was great for that article [20:21]    It was good, with the exception of the high load failure. [20:22]    I think we'd be better using the one on Wikimedia's servers. [20:22]         If WMF doesn't mind that is. [20:22]      Hopefully, Philippe replies soon. [20:22]         I came up with an interesting Audio WN idea today. [20:22]    I doubt they will, it's a WMF site, I don't honestly see that they'd have a problem with it. [20:23]        I imagine they would be ok if its just occasionally and a few people use it [20:23]        but the way its setup currently is not exactly geared for large numbers of people using it [20:23]       Philippe is a pretty on-the-ball guy. I'm sure he'll respond as soon as he has a chance [20:23]      AutisiticPsycho: What's the idea? [20:23]         Wikinews Weekend Review [20:23]         Esentially a recap of the week's stories in audio. [20:24]        I get more the impression etherpad on Wikimedia was more thrown on a spare server one day because someone thought it might be useful to collaborate during some internal meeting [20:24]         Plus highlighting interesting/notable comments by commenters via the comments pages, twitter, facebook, identica. [20:24]      I remember something similiar brought up about the print edition, before that died again. [20:24]         Well... we could toss it on toolserver? [20:24]        potential load issues probably have not been thought out, so they might be wary about opening it to the world so to speak [20:25] [20:25]    bawolff: that's precisely what the fundraising team were using it for. [20:25]        AutisticPsycho: it would be against toolserver rules [20:25]         Oh. [20:25]         bawolff: How so? [20:25]        We're not allowed to install "large" web aps [20:25]        *apps [20:26]         Oh. [20:26]         Bah. [20:26]    bbiab [20:26] |<--    diego has left freenode [20:26]         Anywho. I feel WWR could work. [20:26]        Large web applications may not be installed.... "Installation" here refers to making these available to the public; see further clarification. [20:26]         Since it gives us the entire week to brainstorm and write script. [20:26]        AutisticPsycho: I think it could. Most audio projects seem to fail when people realize they can't keep up the one thing a day rate [20:27]      And how could we advertise that? Ideally, it would help bring in more readers and editors. [20:27]        So these are the things that will brighten the atmosphere at wikinews and change the atmosphere? [20:27] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [20:28]       No, these are merely tools [20:28]       We've found that Mediawiki software isn't exactly... optimal for news writing [20:29]        It's good enough. I have no trouble with it [20:29]       Keep in mind, Mattisse, that we're basically inventing what we're doing day-to-day;). Everything from policy to the Mediawiki extentions that we use, to the javascript tools that are used all over wikinews, are made by the people you see here, and a few others [20:29]       So we're still trying to figure out the best way to do things [20:30]       And yup, that's why we use Mediawiki software. It's "good enough for now", until something better comes along. [20:30]        Yes, anytime the js does something shity, its probably all my fault ;) [20:30]         ok, I'm off to bed. G'night folks. [20:30]       Goodnight [20:30] |<--    thewub has left freenode [20:30]         night wubby [20:30]        That's the strange thing. From my point of view, wikinews has a wonderful interface, with great js gadgets for publishing, commenting etc. Much superior to WP IMO. [20:31]         gopher65: No shit it's not optimal. [20:31]         But hey... that's the challenge. :) [20:31]         Then again... everything else is all corperate based behind firewalls [20:31]       Mattisse: Yeah, and Bawolff and Amgine and Brianmc and a few others have put in a *lot* of work to make it superior than WP:) [20:31]        My view as a newbie who is primarily interested in providing content. [20:31]       It definitely wasn't always that way [20:32]          AutisticPsycho: I think it could. Most audio projects seem to fail when people realize they can't keep up the one thing a day rate Agreed. [20:32]       *to WP. "than". Pffffft. [20:32]       Me and my grammar. *shakes head sadly* [20:32]         I think that's what always hurt Audio Wikinews News Briefs. [20:32]        I'm talking about my experience now. That is why it is strange that wikinews can't keep contributors. [20:32]        Honestly, a lot of foundation projects for Wikipedia seem to fit our needs better than Wikipedia's [20:33]        flagged revs. LQT to some extent [20:33]         Also... at least most of our conflict is only with WP. [20:33]         Remember when we had our fights with Commons also? [20:33]       Mattisse: News is also a lot more work than Encyclopedic content. On Wikipedia someone starts a stub article, and it slowly gets expanded and improved over several years. Here the same process has to happen over the course of hours. That's a lot of pressure. [20:34] -->|    JoeGazz84 has joined #wikinews-workshop [20:34]        AutisticPsycho: yep [20:34]        Why is wikinew not on the mainpage of Wikipedia? Instead they have an awful cockedup "In the news' section that is crap. [20:34]        We're linked [20:34]      I agree [20:34]         We're linked. [20:34]      They should get news from ENWN though [20:35]        In the news is in theory supposed to be encyclopedic articles that are currently timely in regards to current events [20:35]    Mattise: We're linked, but Wikipedia has recently had some editors declare that they consider Wikipedia to be superior to Wikinews, and that we're effectively "redundant". [20:35]      NOTNEWS... [20:35]         Yep. [20:35] [20:35]      I think WikiNews is a better source to Wikipedia for news [20:35]      Personally [20:35]      I never use wikipedia for current thing [20:35]       They have a group of editors on Wikipedia who are strongly opposed to further interaction with Wikinews. Those editors think that Wikipedia should be covering news events, despite Wikipedia having a "NO NEWS" policy. They therefore see us as a threat to getting the No News WP policy revoked. [20:36]    It came about after the Earthquake in Japan recently. Because we didn't get our first story out for 4 hours, they thought they were better cause their first "article" went out 30 minutes after the quake struck [20:36]        But you don't have a section like "Today's featured picture" [20:36]         Yes. But neither do all the other projects. [20:37]         The only two that have those are Commons and WP. [20:37]        gopher65: however in my experiance thats the minority of Wikipedia [20:37]         AFAIK [20:37]      Do they realize that Wikinews is a lot smaller community [20:37]        You could have a section of sample wikinews articles. [20:37]        AutisticPsycho: actually we used to have that. We ran out of pictures [20:37] ) [20:37]       We could though. It's just a matter of 2 or 3 people here wanting to start and maintain a "picture of the day" section [20:37] -->|    Nascar1996 has joined #wikinews-workshop [20:37]         bawolff: Oh yes we did. [20:37]    Mattise: our way around that is the headlines on the front page, and the copy down the side listing our recent work [20:37]       If people want to, they can. [20:37]        Hello Nascar1996. Welcome to the meeting :) [20:38]         Nasacar. [20:38]    Those headlines in a way are our five top articles, i'd suppose. They change as other stuff does. [20:38]        But that is the question: why is it such a small community when theoretically it has so much going for it. [20:38]         Back to etherpad for a second. [20:38]         We have 3 choices. [20:38]     I was just about to ask if I could be here. [20:38]         1. Wikinewsie.org install [20:38]        Nascar1996: yes, you can be here :) [20:38]         2. the WMF etherpad [20:38]         3. Use an external etherpad host [20:39]    AutisticPsycho: I'd go for 2, with 3 as a backup [20:39]        Hi Mascar, I miss you so. You are a wonderful spirit, despite whatever mistakes you make. [20:39]     *Nascar [20:39]     Thank you. [20:40]        Mattise: We also ignore many of the ideas sterotypically identified to make Wikis grow... [20:40]         Nascar1996: Come back. [20:40]         We want you. [20:40]         Just don't be an ass so much. [20:41]    ... [20:41]        Nascar1996: yes, you're pretty much self-exiled at this point. You're welcome to come back any time you like [20:41]      no comment If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. I need to remember this. Since then I have. [20:42]     "If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all." I was regarding myself, not anyone else. Just wanted to clear that up. [20:43]        Nascar is one of the elements that made this site possible for me. It was his blocking/banning that freaked me out and brought to a head my questioning of the way wikinews is run. [20:43]     Wikinews is run well, though we don;t deal with drama that well. [20:43]    Even I'm trying to make an effort at the moment. Albeit it's a slow one, but damnit I'm trying. [20:44]        I appreciate the effort you are making BarkingFish, and it gives me hope. [20:44]    Things don't change overnight, but people can fix them. It just takes a good swift kick up the to make them realise they ARE in the wrong. [20:45]    And that's what I've needed to make me get my own act together. If I can make the effort, and you know what I'm like, I'm sure others can. [20:45]        Thank you so much! [20:45]     BarkingFish, don't be so hard on yourself. [20:47]        Nascar1996: yes suddenly getting overloaded with drama seems to be a recurring event [20:47]    Nascar1996: I'm not. I'm telling the truth. Real life has a bad effect on me and the way I behave elsewhere. Working with 600 hardnuts daily tends to turn you into one. It's the separation between here and work that I need to make to revise my own behaviour here. [20:47]       What is it you do BarkingFish? [20:48]    I'm a Prison Officer, gopher65 [20:48]       Ah, nice. [20:48]     Lets stay on topic, what all were you all discussing? [20:48] * bawolff       will eventually post logs btw [20:48]        But the drama isn't necessary. [20:48]     Prior to me joining. [20:49]        Once Wikimedia stops giving me 500 errors for no appearent reason [20:49]       We were talking about using Etherpad more, and we were looking for a good one [20:49]       We were also talking about audiowikinews [20:49]     All interesting topics. [20:49]       Yes, what development are going on about that? [20:50]       And maybe creating a weekly audionews report, in an attempt to slow down burnout among our audionewies [20:50]        And improving the atmosphere so that contributors don't leave like flies. [20:50]       I'm not sure phearson [20:50]       Right. [20:50]    phearson: The suggestion came up to do a weekly review type cast, sort of a 7 day look back [20:50]       I don't know what else, because I joined halfway through [20:50] * Nascar1996    thinks we need to get print version back first. [20:50]    I joined about 20 minutes before the scheduled end, so I'm clueless too gopher65 [20:50]        I'm not sure how many people actually read the print edition [20:51]        Most of the time it was just one user [20:51]        Consider encouraging collaboration so that the stress is shared and a feeling of community is built [20:52]       Yeah, that's actually the central idea behind the various things we're working on Mattise. [20:52]    That's what we're supposed to be doing already, Mattise - but the constant drama has been a big breaker to the community "feeling". [20:52]     Most probably just skim through the news contents. [20:52]        Actually, it's Mattisse [20:52]       The stress of Wikinews article writing has traditional landed on two people for any given article: the first writes the article, the second reviews it. [20:52]    yeah, it's just that the nick you're popping up under comes up first in my tab complete :) [20:53]       That makes it much more stressful to write here than Wikipedia, and it drives up our user attrition rate like crazy. [20:53]    I'll remember to double click to get the right one :) [20:53]        I do think delays to review reduces contributions somewhat. People like instant gratification [20:54]       EtherPad might help spread the stress of article writing a bit. [20:54]        Why don't more people collaborate to get an article published? [20:54]     Mattise, you can change your nick name /nick  [20:54]       While the new audio project might do a bit of the same thing for audiowikinews. [20:55]    You're in the channel twice anyway, Mattisse - if you want to just use the one nick, that would help :) [20:55]       Well... I don't know exactly. It just usually ends up working out that one person writes an aritcle [20:55]        One thing I did think about the print edition, would be that it'd be better as a weekly type format to be more magaziny, more a best of Wikinews things [20:55]        Yes, the audio project is good as there are many people who can't read print for one reason or another. [20:55]    I think the biggest problem is "edit conflicting" [20:55]       Personally, the few articles that I've worked on collaboratively over the years have been far more fun than solo writing [20:56] [20:56]     I loved writing Wikinews articles. [20:56]    Collaboration on an article in its present form is hard when you go to submit your work and find someone's already changed what you were contributing to while you were working on it. [20:56]        typically the only things that get really collaborative are big disasters [20:56]    It can be labour intensive sometimes you get your edit to submit. [20:56]        lodon subway bombings for example [20:56]        *london [20:56]    *to get your edit to submit. [20:56]        I've explained the double name thing multiple times above. The next time I start up web chat the name will be right. [20:56]        For a while we were the number one hit for london of cc-by sites on google [20:57]    Ok Mattisse - I'm sorry, but i have missed much of the conversation here, due to joining quite late, apologies :) [20:58]        I know the feeling of someone changing "your article" right when you are in the middle of writing it. But maybe that feeling just has to be dealt with for the sake of the community. [20:58]        Mattise, I agree with that, I think much of the issues are cultural [20:59]         Collaborating on an article can be laborious, but definitely worth in in the end [20:59]       That's one of the other reasons why we're investigating the use of EtherPad. It allows many people to work on the same article at exatcly the same time, and see each other's changes in real time [20:59]        Wikipedia's no ownership of articles policy is pretty much the opposite of what we do here [20:59]       It's great:) [20:59]    What we really need to do is to use the etherpads as much as possible, build live, post the notes on the collaboration page, and submit the article from combined work [21:00]       Yupyup [21:00]    A little more effort, yes, but it would mean that we could get multiple editors working with no risk of edit conflicts [21:00]    We'd all be working on it at the same time [21:00]       Here's what I see happening eventually: [21:01]       We'll have a main EtherPad page, and instead of logging on to Wikinews when we want to write a story, we'll go there. On that main page, will be a list of all the stories currently being worked on. [21:01]        But it is selfish. It's great to rack up the number of articles "I" have written. But isn't there other ways of rewarding productivity? I admit that a positive of wikinews over WP is that you get to "own" the article. But is that best overall for the project? The project is failing, isn't it? [21:01]       If the story you're interested in is being worked on, you join that Pad, and start it up [21:02]        Mattise: rumours of our demise have been greatly exagerating [21:02]       If it isn't, you add the article you're working on to the list, and create a new pad for it. [21:02]        goher65, that's a good idea. [21:02]       That way we can have multiple articles writen all at the same time:) [21:02]         I think it'd be fun [21:02]        People have said we're failing almost from day one. I have yet to believe it [21:02]        Look at the numbers [21:02]        page views are up ;) [21:02]        other stuff is down... [21:02]       from when to when? [21:03]       We haven't been failing, but we haven't exactly been succeeding. What we've been doing so far is mainly just building the tools that we need to eventually succeed, and occasionally publishing an article while we do it [21:03]        wikinews is tolerated, probably because it would be more trouble to shut it down. [21:03]     Actually the amount of articles we published most of this month is up compared to the same days in February. [21:03]        Mattise: compared to wikiversity? [21:03]       I think we're finally getting close to the point where we have the minimum required toolset to actually, you know, write news:P. Nearly there. :) [21:03]      bawolff: Tempodivalse set up page for the log, btw. [21:04]        Wikimedia tends to only shut down projects in rather extreme cases [21:04]      http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews:IRC_workshop [21:04]        Mikemoral: oh good, I've been trying to post to a subpage just as a space, but wmf servers hate me... [21:04]    and even then, discussion on shutting a wikimedia project can take *months* [21:04]      Or for dead projects, like simple.wikiquote. [21:04] * bawolff       still mad about tlh.wikipedia.org [21:04]    I know one discussion at least which was argued over for well over a year. [21:05]       Klingon? [21:05]        I think the 9/11 wiki is the only "project" thats been shut down. [21:05]        gopher65: yep [21:05]    And yet there are new options opening too. There is talk of a wiki written in a special system called "Signwriting", built for the ASL community. [21:06]        Used to exist. I even had an account there [21:06]        BarkingFish: yeah I've heard of it [21:06]        Are you going to argue that wikinews doesn't have an "atmosphere" problem and that editors are leaving? [21:06]        GeraldM likes to blog about signwriting [21:06] |<--    diego has left freenode [21:06]       Arabic Wikinews has been utterly dead for years now, but it's still around. Surprisingly. [21:06]        Mattise: Don't get me wrong, there are issues [21:06]    We do have an atmosphere problem, Mattise - even I can't deny that. [21:06]        But I think "failing" is going too far [21:07]       I guess it doesn't take much in the way of harddrive space to maintain a very small project. As someone on Wikipedia recently quipped at me when I suggested deleting an aritcle: [21:08]        We keep deleted articles, so it takes just as much space to delete it ;) [21:08]       "If we need to, we can whip up a funderraiser for the WMF for the 50 bucks they'd need to by another 5 terabytes." [21:08]    The biggest thing I see in contributor issues is a comparison between Wikinews & Wikipediaa. Bear with me for a moment. [21:08]       *bye [21:08]    *Wikipedia [21:08]        But wikinews could be really good. [21:08]    Look at our user creation logs. [21:08]       It will be:). It just won't happen instantly. [21:08]    We get about 10 signups for accounts per day. Most never get used. [21:08]    Wikipedia gets upwards of 1000 signups per day. [21:09]        Wikipedia has a slightly better google rank then us :P [21:09]         Not many of those are ever used either [21:09]        also the majority of created accounts are auto-created SUL things I'd imagine [21:10]         Bbl shower [21:10] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:10]        WP has an active recruitment program, mentoring programs, programs that reach out to real world organizations. It solicits professional input .... [21:10]    The question is, how can we put ourselves out there on the level playing field with WP, whilst our active contributor base is so low. [21:11]    Most of the people write news. We don't have a wide enough base I feel to assign people to "jobs" like mentoring and stuff. [21:11] |<--    Nemo_bis has left freenode [21:11]      Assign, no. But we can get people to volunteer. [21:12] * bawolff       thinks we have to be careful to avoid defining our selves in terms of Wikipedia [21:12]    If we could have people who would take specific roles, like a recruitment co-ordinator, mentors, advisors, etc, that would help. [21:12]    Yes Mikemoral - but if those people volunteer, will the quality and quantity of their general contribution to newswriting suffer as a result? [21:12]        I'm not defending WP. I don't even think most of their articles are very good. But they do work at improving the place. And one big issue they work on is improving civility and holding Admins accountable for their actions, plus expecting Admins to set explanatory behavioral examples. [21:13]      Since they volunteered, obviously they were willing. [21:13]      to help [21:13]    There's a difference between willingness, and having the time to be willing :) [21:14]    If they find they can't cope with both after a while, we're back to square one [21:14]        There is a large issue of "vested ediors" who no one will block etc. and they are chipping away at that. [21:14]        The problem with blocking admins, is it just doesn't work out well [21:14]       Also, no active admins here at any given time during a disruption. [21:15]    As we should be too, Mattise - no one is above the rules. [21:15]        No one purposely does something that they think is wrong [21:15]        It is being done increasingly at WP plus an increased rate of desyping of Admins for behavior that was routinely tolerated before. [21:16]        So when blocking admins, people tend to get in fights about, I'm in just as much a position to determine if my behaviour is wrong as you are) [21:16] * Bleep is pleased that he's not the only one to see two of the main issues with WN as a newbie. [21:16] * bawolff       does not want to see us go back to the days where admins had wheel wars... [21:16] |<--    diego has left freenode [21:16]       not enough AGF here also... [21:16]  As in, flawed PR and certain users being held, err, as if they're the be-all-and-end-all. [21:17] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:17]    Bleep: The issue of PR is being looked into, I believe. There is discussion somewhere about unreviewed articles being allowed to go to the main page as published [21:18]        There has been a cultural shift. WP wants to appeal globally. The standards of North American/British editors etc. are increasingly being questioned as automatically right. Because these tend to be "old timers" this is a difficult process but it is moving forward. [21:18]    Mattise: It depends on what you define as an old timer :) [21:18]    I've been with Wikipedia 6 years, but only 2 with Wikinews. [21:18]        BarkingFish: in theory, thats what we were going to discuss here [21:19]  BarkingFish: Yeah I've been keeping an eye on it, but I'm trying not to get too involved with non-content stuff here. I have enough drama at my "home wiki". [21:19]  BarkingFish: Though I disagree with anything to publish un-peer-reviewed articles. [21:19]        People who joined 2006 and before, when it was "their" place to run as they wanted. [21:20]        Thats probably a short list [21:20]    Joined here? [21:20]        thats like Me, amgine, brianmc, maybe TUFKAAP [21:21]        Agee with BarkingFish that nothing unreviewed should be published. A quick way to lose credibility, besides all the other reasons, copyvio, inaccuracy etc. Does wikinews have a BLP policy: [21:21]        not paticularly [21:22]        Technically BLP is a foundation policy, and all projects are urged to follow it i think [21:22]      But not required? [21:22]    Mattise: I think you misunderstand. I agree with unreviewed articles being published. It would be one way to shorten the queue for people wanting their work on the site without the wait. [21:22]        Mattise: we sort of have https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikinews/en/wiki/Wikinews:COE [21:22]        Joined WP. I have no idea what the history is here, but I recognisze some of the "old timer" behaviior that is problematic at WP. [21:22]    The option is still there for editors to peer review the work though [21:22]  All we need is for people who get reviewer status to actually review articles. [21:22]        meh, we did unreviewed articles for quite a long time. The sky never fell [21:23]  And not make it so hard to get said right. [21:23]    Bleep: And that entirely depends on how much time they have to contribute to doing that. [21:23] * bawolff       considers nominating Bleep for reviewer on that note [21:23]       I don't think the revised BLP were ever adopted, were they? [21:23]       *BLP policy was [21:23]  BarkingFish: I don't disagree at all, but, for example, instead of all the conversations spent on how to "fix" the system, several articles could have been reviewed. [21:24]        I think a large issue is the responsibilities of a reviewer are ill-defined [21:24]        No BLP policy is a problem for WMF. [21:24]      When I got review, I had only written 2-3 articles, now the requirements are much, much higher. [21:24]  All I'm saying is that it's not just time, it's also an urge. [21:24]  Mikemoral: Yeah, that's another issue. [21:24]    Bleep: True. But policy has got to be discussed before it can be fixed. [21:24]        Mikemoral: really, I thought you predated the reviewer system [21:24] * Bleep has been told not to apply for reviewer yet. [21:24]       I think we are getting off track here... [21:24]        I agree. There needs to be clear standards for reviewer to follow. It would help them and the article writer also. [21:24] * bawolff       wants to go back to easy come easy go [21:24]  Apparently, 4 articles, 4 years WMF and my own e-magazine mean I would fail the bar. [21:25]      bawolff: No, April 2009. [21:25]  bawolff: I wouldn't accept per above ^ [21:25]  BarkingFish: What's wrong with the policy, though? If it's not broken, don't fix it. [21:25]        Mikemoral: hmm, thought you were older then that. I suppose we've had reviewer though for a long time now [21:26]        Bleep, many people feel that reviewer results in loss of contributors, due to delay in getting articles reviewed [21:26]        What policy an where is it? [21:26]  And, as a "noob", it doesn't seem broken to me - just flawed because people don't review. [21:26]    Bleep The problem is not that it's broken, the fact is that some of it is far from clear, and in some cases doesn't exist at all. [21:26]       The only thing wrong with the current Peer Review sytem is that it requires a minimum number of people involved in the project in order for it to work smoothly. We're a few contributors short right now [21:26]       That's all [21:26]  Speaking personally, I'd happily spend more time reviewing than writing, but apparently I'm not going to get it until I've written 20 million OR articles. Likewise for accred. [21:27]        Agree. Need review standards so reviewers know what they are supposed to do. [21:27]        +1 [21:27]       If we can get 10 or 15 more semi-active people here, the review problem would disappear [21:27]    If there was a prize for material written in such a way that few people without a lot of time and patience could understand it, some of our stuff would win hands down [21:27] * bawolff       has been here since 2005, and I still have no idea to what extent a reviewer is responsible to checking the article [21:27]  bawolff: I don't disagree - the problem is that people *don't* review - for example, there's enough of us here, talking, now to clear the review queue. [21:28]       So really, what the whole "review times are long" debate comes back to is "how do we get more contributors, so that the PR system will work properly?". [21:28]    The things we need to do is not fix the policy, per se, but to reword it and make it clearer for contributors, new or old, to understand from the start [21:28]      People don't like reviewing, that's the problem I see. [21:28]  BarkingFish: Very true - I'll admit I've not looked enough to know everything inside out, so I guess that probably needs sorting, along with what Mattise is saying. [21:28]        There's also the larger issue, that many people don't get joy out of reviewing. At the end of the day, in volunteer projects, annoying things get done [21:28]        Especially big annoying tasks that have to be done all in one go by a single person [21:28]        I would review, except for the atmosphere here. I don't think fact checking is that hard. [21:29] * Bleep would also review. [21:29]    bawolff: that's precisely how I fell into the trap of resigning reviewer [21:29]       It's not hard. Copycheck is a bit harder, and grammar fixing can be time consuming [21:29]        My understanding of what I feel a proper check would consist of takes me roughly 2 hours for a rather short article [21:30]    A big annoying task that had to be done in one go, but that's another story entirely. [21:30]        I feel other people have severely differing standards [21:30]       It's just that sometimes when you log on and you see "8 articles awaiting review", it feels so overwhelming that you don't know where to begin. That's a lot of work. [21:30]        I would fact check everything, but then that is my background. [21:30]       I find that I'm actually much more likely to review an article if there are only 2 in the queue than if there are 7 [21:30]    gopher65: then you get incidents like mine, "I'll review your article if you clear the review list" [21:30] -->|    Tempodivalse has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:30]       Heh [21:30]      Hi Tempodivalse. [21:30] ||    Tempodivalse has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:30]        yay Tempodivalse [21:30]   hi [21:31]        Little late to the party ;) [21:31]   ugh, i just *had* to ping timeout [21:31]   Did someone get the logs? [21:31]      bawolff did, [21:31]        Tempodivalse: yes, and its still ongoing [21:31]    Result, 1 copyvio with serious consequences getting through, an article with the same source 3 times and me failing badly, gopher65 [21:31]   bawolff: yeah, i was stupid and forgot i already had another engagement [21:31]        no worries, it happens [21:31]   got stuck in bad traffic [21:31]        no worries, it happens [21:31]   got stuck in bad traffic [21:32]        as an aside, the log is now up to 84 kb [21:33]        and we've gone on long enough that its actual past 21:00 in my actual timezone ;) [21:33]    Tempodivalse: I had another engagement too, i wasn't expecting this to be still going when I got home from my union meeting [21:33]       As a rough guide, I find that it usually takes me ~10 minutes per 100 words to review an article. A 400 word article takes me about 3/4 of an hour. [21:33]   Yeesh. Driving on a two-lane road at night with no streetlights when it's overcast and rainy is ... not fun. [21:33]   I'm impressed we got so many users in here [21:33]   did we get any non-wikinewsie wikipedians ? [21:33]       But I thoroughly read every source, fully fact and copycheck, occasionally google lines from an article to see if they came from somewhere else, etc. [21:33]       A thorough article review takes quite a while. [21:33]    Tempodivalse: I think Avic is a non wikinewsie, I don't recognise the nick anyway [21:33]      JoeGazz, maybe. [21:33]       We have JoeGazz84 in here before. I think he's a wikipedian? [21:33] |<--    BarkingFish has left freenode [21:34]      yep [21:34]      I am [21:34]       Oh, he's still here:) [21:34]      I support Wikinews too [21:34] -->|    BarkingFish has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:34] * JoeGazz84     idles a lot [21:34]      :P [21:34]        I'm non wikiwise. I don't get most of what's happening [21:34] -->|    Failz has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:34]    sorry about that [21:34]    Wifi dropped off [21:34] |<--    Bleep has left freenode [21:34] =-=     Failz is now known as Bleep [21:34]      bawolff: Were you keeping the logs online or offline? [21:34]       BarkingFish: Heh, I don't remember that incident. [21:34]        they're offline [21:35]        they will be online soon though [21:35]   So is the meeting still ongoing? [21:35]      Yep. [21:35]        yeah [21:35]   wow [21:35]         JoeGazz84: Why don't you join us then? :) [21:35]    gopher65: Search Wikinews for Alexander Lukashenko, that should give you a clue :) [21:36]    brb [21:36]      AutisticPsycho: I'm not good at articles/news stuff [21:36]      Just maintenance [21:36]      :P [21:36] * JoeGazz84     has the logs if needed :) [21:38]        JoeGazz84: stuff like copyediting is always welcome as well [21:41]      Ah [21:41]        So this is kind of sounding like the end of the meeting. [21:41]        Anything else anyone wants to say? [21:41]      It's been mention before that we could split the work in the peer review process. [21:41]      I'm wondering how we can get that to work well. [21:41]        I think there has been some consensus that the atmosphere needs to be friendlier, that newbies should be offered more help with their articles rather than treated harshly, that figuring out a way of collaborating would be good and take the pressure off single editors, that maybe the issue of article "ownership" should be examined in favor of a more collaborative community, that reviewers... [21:41]        ...need clear standards so that they will be more comfortable reviewing. Maybe more. Make sure the BLP policy is compliant with WMF, because regular BLP violations is something that would encourage the shut down of wikinews. And the articles are often about living people, but if the sourcing is good, there should be no problem. [21:41]      Oh darn, I just invited Pi zero. [21:41] |<--    diego has left freenode [21:42]        Thats ok. If he shows up it'd be good [21:42]        I would like to hear Pi zero's views and ideas. [21:42]       Our stuff always has to be sourced [21:42]        I think he was already aware of it [21:42]     Hi, I'm back. [21:42]       The only way it could possibly be an issue would be with Original Reporting articles [21:42] -->|    diego has joined #wikinews-workshop [21:42]       So hopefully BLP won't become a problem [21:43] [21:43] [21:43] [21:43]        I think there's been more then one questionable article [21:43]        I don't remember anyone trying to sue us [21:43]       Most were pre-peer review though [21:43]        There was the piano man one [21:44] * bawolff       is unsure if they really were mostly pre-peer review. /me would like to see stats [21:45]       The great thing about Peer Review is that it filters out a lot of the crap.

[[India's population increases by 181 million in ten years]]India's {w|2011 census of India|2011 census} reports  that its {w|Population|population}  has increased by 181 million in the span of one decade, a figure  17.6 percent greater than  2001. The census results, publicised today, show the population of India now stands at 1.21 billion. C. Chandramauli, the commissioner of the census, said India's population represents "over 17 percent of the world population, [while] India is 2.4 percent of the world¡¯s surface area." According to {w|BBC News Online}, the current population of the country is in excess of the populations of Pakistan, Indonesia,  Bangladesh, Brazil and the United States put together. While India's population has increased by more than 17 percent since the 2001 census, this growth rate is the lowest since India achieved independence in 1947. Between 1991 and 2011, the population growth rate has steadily decreased. Approximately 25 percent of Indians over the age of seven were found to be {w|Literacy|illiterate} in the 2011 census, a decrease of 10 percent from the census held ten years ago. The increase in literate females is greater than that of males, the new census reports. The findings have suggested a preference of male over female children. For every one thousand boys below the age of seven, there were 914 girls, a decrease from the 2001 census, which reported 927 female for every one thousand male children. Chandramauli called this discovery "a matter of grave concern. This is the lowest ever in the demographic history of the country," he said, and noted "[t]he last census in 2001 had warned us about this, the tendency has worsened." This pattern continues although the {w|Government of India|Indian government} has prohibited hospitals from disclosing the gender of an {w|Fetus|unborn child}.According to {w|The Washington Post}, parents in much of India {w|abortion|abort} female fetuses and {W|murder} young female children for financial reasons. Incidents like this occur more frequently in the better educated and the richer Indian states, including {w|Punjab} and {w|Gujarat}. G.K. Pillai, the home secretary, has claimed that "[w]hatever policy measures we have been following in the last 40 years will need a complete review now. They have not been effective".There are now 940 female adults for every one thousand men, in contrast to 2001, when there were 933 women per thousand males. However, in the capital, {w|Delhi}, only 866 females were counted for every one thousand males.Throughout the states of India, the population growth rate varies significantly. This results in an inequality in the allocation of funds and is a problem, experts say.  According to Management Institute of Population and Development consultant Devendra Kothari: "Our federal government sends funds to the states according to their population. This means that the states that have worked harder to reduce their population growth get less money from New Delhi". Kothari continued: "The states with lesser population send fewer members to the Indian parliament. Their financial and political clout will go down."Over the course of the approaching year, concluding census figures will be publicised, according to officials.== Sources == 
[[Scotland's oldest detainee facing attempted murder charges]]A man thought to be the oldest person ever held in custody in Scotland is facing charges of attempted murder. Sylvester 'Eddie' Nowak, 98, is imprisoned in hospital for {W|psychiatric} evaluation after a court appearence; it is alleged he used a knife and axe to attack two police officers.Nowak had been alone in his home in {W|Scone, Scotland|Scone}, {W|Perthshire} on Tuesday after leaving hospital on Monday. A carer became alarmed for his well-being and summoned police. {W|Tayside Police} said in a statement two officers attended "which would be deemed appropriate. This incident happened upon their arrival and then a number of further officers attended at the scene to assist."It is claimed Nowak attacked WPC Shona Beattie, 42, with a knife and WPC Katie Deas, 23, with both an axe and a knife. Beattie was wounded in the arm and hospitalised after an ambulance trip, and underwent surgery on Wednesday. Deas was uninjured.Polish {W|World War Two} veteran Nowak has extreme hearing difficulty, his initial court appearance before Perth Sheriff Court delayed to move the case to a second courtroom with equipment catering for hearing aids. Two more hours of delay followed when Nowak remained unable to hear and Wednesday's hearing ultimately took place in the original room. He was helped by guards from security firm {w|Reliance} as he walked.Nowak is an ex-prisoner of the Nazis but escaped to Italy before settling in the UK. Previously living in {W|Dundee}, he has lived in his Scone home since the 1960s. He has no relatives in Scotland. 81-year-old friend and neighbour Jim Grant paints a picture of a highly independant individual."Eddie keeps himself to himself... He never wanted any help and turned down all offers from the social services. He never answered the door or his phone to anyone, carers included. I had a secret knock on his window which is how he knew to let me in." Grant says all Nowak's family live in Poland.Following the private court appearance, Sheriff Peter Hammond sent Nowak to the Murray Royal, a mental hospital, for assessment. The order lasts 28 days, and Nowak is anticipated to be back in court later.== Sources == 
[[US woman sentenced to jail for faking son¡¯s cancer]]A Michigan judge sentenced a woman to  a year in jail Tuesday for giving her twelve-year-old son drugs  so that he appeared to have {w|leukemia|leukemia} and telling him he was dying. She also shaved his eyebrows and head. The motive was to fool her son,  relatives and the community, including  churchs, into thinking he had {w|cancer}  in a {w|Confidence trick|scam} to collect money."Your conduct, ma¡¯am, in this case is reprehensible. To tell a vulnerable, defenseless young boy that he is dying of cancer for your own pecuniary gain is almost beyond the realm of comprehension," said Judge Caretti. "To then give your son strong opiate-based pills crushed up in his {w|apple sauce} to further your despicable scheme defies all reason." Schnuphase's attorney Greco said Schnuphase was suffering from the stress of the loss of her job and "vehemently denies" drugging her son. She claims she gave him  {w|acid reflux} medicine. "It was the snowball effect. She didn't feel she could get out of it," Greco said. "She was basically at the end of her rope."Schnuphase's cousin, Patrick Kelsch, called the sentence "ridiculous" and said, "She's made a living as a {w|Confidence trick|con artist} for years." He added, "She's always had a sinister side." A hearing to terminate Schnuphase¡¯s parental rights to her son will be held in April.== Sources == 
[[British haulage managing director Edward Stobart dies at age 56]]Edward Stobart, famed for his construction of the {w|Stobart Group|Eddie Stobart} truck empire and being its {w|Chief executive officer|chief executive officer} for over thirty years, has died at the age of 56. In a statement, the Stobart Group commented: "It is with great sadness and regret that Stobart Group shares the news that Edward Stobart, son of Eddie Stobart, passed away at 8:10 AM this morning at {w|University Hospital Coventry}, after heart problems yesterday."When Eddie Stobart ¡ª Edward's father, who is aged over eighty ¡ª created the company during the 1950s in {w|Cumbria} in northern England, it originally involved itself in the business of agriculture. In the 1970s, the business was given the name Eddie Stobart Limited and became a haulage service. Eddie Stobart then handed over the company to his son. The enterprise subsequently became the most popular of that industry within the United Kingdom, according to {w|BBC News Online}; it extended to include transportation by air and railways, as well as warehousing and management of {w|Logistics|logistics}.Due to the {w|Cult following|cult following} that they had achieved via a {w|Fandom|fanbase} of 'Stobart spotters', which involves the observation of their company's uniquely named vehicles, the Stobart Group decided to create an official followers' group, which now has in excess of twenty-five thousand members. Eddie Stobart-branded merchandise has also been released.William Stobert ¡ª the brother of Edward Stobart ¡ª and Andrew Tinkler purchased the business from Edward in 2004. Edward subsequently relocated to the {w|Midlands} and took over what was to become an unsuccessful {w|Trailer|truck trailer} building firm in 2009.Edward Stobart experienced his death in {w|Coventry}, England at 0810 {w|British Summer Time|BST} on Thursday. The Stobart Group have expressed their condolences to "Edward's wife Mandy, his children and family at this difficult time."Haulage firm Preston's of Potto's chairwoman Ann Preston described Edward as "the most iconic figure that has ever been in this industry" and that the death of a man who "was very passionate about road transport" and "didn't want to do anything else" since he was a child was "a massive loss". The Stobart Members' Club have stated: "The club's members will certainly have fond memories of the man who started the phenomenon off, created the iconic Eddie Stobart brand and made it cool to spot lorries. Stobart Spotting will continue and the legacy of Edward Stobart will live on."== Sources == 
[[Australia to lose $2 billion due to Japanese disasters]]The fallout from  earthquake and tsunami catastrophes in Japan   will cost Australia about {w|AUD|A$}2 billion in lost export earnings in the near term due to lower  Australian exports to Japan, according to estimates in a {w|Department of the Treasury|Treasury} brief released Thursday. After China, Japan is Australia¡¯s largest export market, making up 15 percent of its total exports. Short term exports of "non-rural {w|Bulk cargo|bulk commodities}" are predicted to be lower as Japanese port facilities, coal-fired power stations and steel-making plants were damaged. Businesses whose export products are designated for Japan must find other customers to replace Japanese clients, the brief said. The loss of Japanese markets has been a contributor to a 6 percent drop in the price {w|of iron ore}  and an 8 percent drop in the price of {w|coal}. Japan imports account for 27 percent of Australia's iron ore and coal exports.Also on Thursday, Japan's manufacturing production index experienced  its sharpest fall in the decade since  data has been collected, indicating a steep fall in output for  most businesses in Japan in March. Recently, Japanese industry seemed to be rebounding from the {w|Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis}.In Asia, concern is mounting that the electricity shortages and other disruptions to Japan's manufacturing sector will affect manufacturing in various areas of Asia, since the manufacturing of many goods are dependent on the integrated network of {w|supply chain}s.== Sources == 
[[More of Gaddafi's top officials defect]]A number of new reports suggest that more of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's inner circle have deserted him.Al Jazeera reports that a group of top officials who "headed to Tunisia for talks have decided to stay there". Among the defectors reported are the head of Libya's Popular Commitee, Mohammad Abu Al Qassim Al Zawi, and {w|Abuzed Omar Dorda|Abu Zayed Dordah}, Libya's prime minister from 1990 to 1994. Gaddafi's Europe minister and head of intelligence have also defected according to reports. Security sources suggest that the total number of defectors could be up to a dozen. Yesterday Ali al-Treiki, foreign minister of Gaddafi's cabinet, announced he had cut ties with the leader, while officials in London have been checking reports that the deputy head of Gaddafi's mission in London, Tarek Khalid Ibrahim, is planning on defection as well. This latest breakthrough follows the defection of Libya's foreign minister, {w|Moussa Koussa}, who abandoned Gaddafi's regime and entered the United Kingdom on Wednesday.== Sources == 
[[Ohio man dies after sitting in chair for two years]]A {w|morbid obesity|morbidly obese} Ohio man died Wednesday after being found unconscious in his home several days earlier. The man had been sitting in a chair for two years and was physically fused to it when he was discovered by two roommates, one of which was his girlfriend.Authorities who arrived at the house in {w|Bellaire, Ohio|Bellaire} reported seeing the man sitting amidst his own urine and feces, which were infested with {w|maggots}. The man's skin had become attached to the recliner's cloth, said law enforcement officers, one of whom had to dispose of his uniform after responding to the home. In order to transport the man to the hospital, officers had to carve out a portion of the wall.Identified as 43-year-old Richard Hughes, the man died after being taken to Wheeling Hospital in West Virginia. The residence's landlord said Hughes, weighing 348 pounds, began sitting in the chair after his knees started to hurt, and refused to get up. Hughes' girlfriend told police that she fed him because he was unable to move around.Jim Chase, a city official, called the room where the man stayed "very filthy, very deplorable" and said it was "unbelievable that somebody live[d] in conditions like that."== Sources == 
[[Treasury reveals cost of carbon tax on Australian families]]Treasury documents released today under the {w|Freedom of Information} act reveal that Australians could face up to an {w|Australian dollar|A$}863 rise  in household costs per annum if the {w|Government of Australia|government} proceeds with its plans to {w|Carbon_tax#Australia|put a tax on carbon emissions}.The documents reveal an a annual price rise of $218.40 for electricity, $114.40 for gas, $187.20 for petrol and $88.40 for food for the average household. The treasury modelling was based on a $30 carbon tax, but also estimated other prices such as a $40 tax which predicted a rise of over $1,100 to the average household's annual budget. However, they do not take into account the compensation deals and offsets promised by the government if a price is put on carbon. After viewing the treasury modelling, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Climate Change Minister {w|Greg Combet} released a joint statement saying without the finalization of compensation packages it is too early to predict price rises. "No final decisions on the starting price or assistance have been taken and therefore it is far too early to speculate on any potential price impacts," the statement said. Until the final design and modelling have been settled, anyone who uses these figures to scare families about prices is engaging in a dishonest, misleading scare campaign."Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said the figures demonstrated the toll a carbon tax would have on Australian families. This just demonstrates that the Government has known all along that its carbon tax won't clean up the environment but it will clean out your wallet," he said. That's right and this is $863 a year in extra burden that the Australian people shouldn't have to pay. This is an $863 a year hit on families' cost of living. Families are doing it tough as things stand. They don't need a bad situation made much, much worse by Julia Gillard's carbon tax."The {w|Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry} has also officially opposed the adoption of a carbon tax. A resolution was passed by all 30 members at their general meeting to reject the Federal government's plan.    == Sources == 
[[Polar bear Knut's death linked to encephalitis]]Two weeks after the celebrity  {w|polar bear} {w|Knut|Knut} died unexpectedly, an {w|autopsy} report  shows that the immediate cause of death was {w|drowning}. It also reveals Knut was suffering from a {w|Neurological disorder|brain disorder} resulting in a {w|Epileptic seizure|seizure} that led to his fall into the  water.The four-year-old polar bear had been living at the at the {w|Berlin Zoological Garden|Berlin zoo} since birth and was a popular attraction. Just before his death  he  turned around in circles  in front of hundreds of zoo visitors, and then fell into the pool  in his enclosure  and  died. The final autopsy report determined  that a large amount of water was found in his lungs and  the immediate cause of his death was drowning, said  Achim Gruber, {w|Veterinary pathology|animal  pathologist} of {w|Free University of Berlin| Berlin¡¯s Free University}, at a news conference.  The autopsy also  showed  that  Knut was suffering from  {w|encephalitis}, a  swelling and inflammation of the brain that can cause seizures, and  is the likely explanation for his collapse into the pool, according to experts who studied the report. Knut's encephalitis was the result of an undetermined infection that was probably caused by a {w|virus}, said Claudia Szentiks, lead pathologist of Knut's autopsy. Ruled out during the autopsy were causes of encephalitis such as {w|rabies} or a {w|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|prion disease}. Szentiks said, "Given the massive scale of the inflammation, Knut would probably have died sooner or later."The zoo¡¯s  original plan to {w|Taxidermy|stuff} Knut  for display is being vigorously opposed by his fans, who have organized a "Stop the Stuffing of Knut" protest scheduled  for Saturday.
[[Man charged with two counts of attempted murder in south London, England]]Police in London, England, UK have charged a 19-year-old man  with two counts of attempted murder.

[[Daily and Sunday Sport owners to enter administration]]Britain's tabloid {w|Daily Sport} newspaper and its sister title, the more commonly known {w|Sunday Sport}, have ceased publication in the UK effective yesterday.  Owners {w|Sport Media Group} made the announcement the paper was ceasing operations immediately, following warnings back in December 2010 they had experienced "an insufficient recovery".Rescued from collapse by former owner {w|David Sullivan} in 2009, The Daily Sport, first published in 1991, followed on from the Sunday Sport, first published in 1986, which became known for its use of unbelievable and most often untrue headlines, and the more-than-gratuitous use of {w|Page Three|Page 3 girls} throughout the newspaper. If the publications close entirely it will be the first loss of national newspapers in the UK since the disappearance in November 1995 of Today owned by {W|News International}.Previous editors of the newspapers include {w|BBC Radio 5 Live} presenter {w|Tony Livesey}, and it was while he was editor that the reputation for the utterly bizarre making it to the front page was earned.  With headlines claiming such strange things as a {W|Routemaster|London bus} being found in Antarctica and a World War II bomber being found on the moon, for most of their existence, the Daily Sport and the Sunday Sport were not seen as particularly reliable news outlets.At their peaks, both papers barely passed circulation of 190,000 per issue.  The titles were withdrawn from media audits in 2009 following a disastrous drop in sales.In a press release on their website, Sport Media Group says the closure is due to an "inability to meet certain creditors as they fall due".  Trading in SMG shares was suspended yesterday morning pending clarification of their financial position.  "The company is in the process of appointing administrators and will update the market once an appointment has been confirmed," they stated.== Sources == 
[[UN workers killed by Afghans over burning of a Qur'an in Florida]]An Afghan mob attacked a United Nations compound last Friday, killing seven UN workers and setting fire to the compound. The attack occurred  after several hours of peaceful protests, broadcast online, over the burning of a {w|Qur'an} by a Florida pastor.The protest occurred in the northern Afghanistan city of {w|Mazar-e-Sharif} and was in response to reports that controversial US pastor {w|2010_Qur'an-burning_controversy#Pastor_Terry_Jones|Terry Jones} had instigated the burning of a Qur'an on March 20 by his colleague Wayne Sapp at the {w|Dove World Outreach Center} in {w|Gainesville, Florida}. Jones drew {w|2010 Qur'an-burning controversy|criticism last year} when he announced plans to burn Qur'ans on the anniversary of 9/11. At that time there were several protests in Afghanistan. Jones was persuaded not to carry out his plans, influenced by a phone call from  Afghanistan commander {w|David Petraeus|US Gen. David Petraeus} who feared burning the Qur'an would result in the deaths of US military personnel.Friday's attack occurred after several hours of protests by approximately 2000 demonstrators in front of the UN compound in Mazar-e-Sharif that was broadcast online. Demonstrators began to  throw stones, tried to climb the compound walls, and then overwhelmed the  UN guards positioned outside the compound, taking their weapons and shooting at Afghan police. They set parts of the compound on fire.According to {w|Reuters}, three UN staff and four {w|Gurkha} guards were killed. The  UN victims included personnel from Nepal, Norway, Sweden and Romania. The UN is still in the process of determining the exact death toll and the extent of the damage. At least four demonstrators were killed also.== Sources ==

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team banned by FIFA]]The {w|Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|national football team} of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been banned by {w|FIFA}, the sport's international governing body.

The change was rejected on Wednesday during an NSBIH meeting, causing FIFA and European football governing body {w|UEFA} to make the decision to suspend the federation.FIFA and UEFA said in a statement that "[t]he NSBIH representative and club teams are no longer entitled to take part in international competitions as of 1 April 2011 and until the aforementioned problem is solved. This also means that, as of 1 April 2011, no NSIBH official or representative may participate in any international match or event."The Bosnia and Herzegovina national team's manager, {w|Safet Susic}, spoke out against FIFA's ruling, blaming politics for the demand not being met. He said "[t]here is absolutely no chance that the NSBIH might find a way out of the present deadlock and get the job done. These people are incapable of running the NSBIH properly, although this situation is partly a result of political orders because Bosnia is an ethnically divided country where a dysfunctional system has now caught up with football. Denying the players a chance to perform on the big stage through no fault of their own is like sending innocent people to prison."Bosnia and Herzegovina are currently competing in the qualifying stage of the 2012 European championship. Bosnia are only five points behind group leaders France, and hold a {w|game in hand} over both Belarus and Albania. Unless FIFA's ruling is reversed, it seems unlikely that Bosnia's next game against Romania on June 3 will take place.
[[Police officer killed as car bomb explodes in Omagh, Northern Ireland]]A bomb positioned below the car of a police officer in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom has exploded, killing him. The unidentified 25-year-old officer, recently employed by the {w|Police Service of Northern Ireland} after graduating from a college of police training three weeks prior, was directly involved in the incident as he sat inside the vehicle outside his residence in {w|Omagh}, {w|County Tyrone}, which occurred at a time immediately before 1600 {w|British Summer Time|BST} today. The man, who died at this location, has now been identified as Constable Ronan Kerr. {QuoteLeft|I have absolutely no doubt the overwhelming number of people in NI want to move on. It's only a few Neanderthal who want to go back. They will not drag us back to the past.|source=Peter Robinson, {{w|Northern Ireland Executive} {w|First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister}}}It is currently uncertain as to whether or not any other individuals were killed or injured as a result of the incident. It is also unclear who was responsible for committing the act. It is thought that {w|Dissident republican|dissident republicans} were responsible for the bomb blowing up today, due to numerous similar prior incidents involving them.Gerry Adams, the current president of {w|Sinn F¨¦in}, has stated: "I want to send my condolences to his family at this hugely traumatic time. Sinn F¨¦in is determined that those responsible will not set back the progress of the peace and political process."Over the course of the past one-and-a-half years, numerous incidents of a similar nature have taken place with Police Service of Northern Ireland employees being targeted. Despite various devices being unsuccessful in detonating, a police officer suffered an explosion in January 2010. As a consequence, both of his legs were lost. In a separate incident in May 2008, another police officer lost their legs as the result of a bomb attack. In March 2009, a group of dissident republicans were responsible for fatally shooting a policeman in {w|Craigavon}, {w|County Armagh}.David Cameron, the {w|Prime minister|prime minister} of the United Kingdom, said of today's incident: "Those who carried out this wicked and cowardly crime will never succeed in dragging Northern Ireland back to a dark and bloody past. Their actions are rejected by the overwhelming majority of people right from all parts of the community." Meanwhile, Peter Robinson, the current {w|First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister} of the {w|Northern Ireland Executive}, commented that "[i]t was a young man who was bravely entering the police service, recognising that he was putting his life on the line. I have absolutely no doubt the overwhelming number of people in NI want to move on. It's only a few Neanderthal who want to go back. They will not drag us back to the past."
[[Nine killed as protests spread to Kandahar over Qur'an burning]]Violent protests  over the burning of a  {w|Qur'an} by a US church spread on Saturday to the southern Afghanistan city of {w|Kandahar}, a day after an angry mob attacked a United Nations compound at {w|Mazar-e-Sharif} in northern Afghanistan, killing seven UN workers and four Afghan protesters.According to Kandahar officials,  the protests over the {w|2010 Qur'an-burning controversy|desecration of the Qur'an} in Florida a month ago started peacefully but became violent when   mobs began roaming the streets, vandalizing buildings and burning cars. {w|Afghan National Police|Afghan police} and US soldiers tried to protect a complex of government buildings when a mob attempted to storm them. Nine people were killed, and 73 injured. Some witnesses said that people who refused to join the violence were beaten and stoned. Others said Afghan police shot demonstrators. The police have denied shooting anyone. "There [was] gunfire into the air in order to bring the people under control, and luckily not one has been killed as a result of the gunfire," said Zemarai Bashari,  {w|Ministry of the Interior|Interior Ministry} spokesperson as reported by {w|CNN}. Zalmai Ayoubi, spokesperson for the governor of {w|Kandahar province}, said that Afghan police arrested 17 people, seven of whom were armed and are suspects in the  shooting  of protesters. He blamed  {w|Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents} and their supporters  for infiltrating the demonstration.A Taliban spokesperson, {w|Zabiullah Mujahid|Zabiullah Mojahed},  denied that the Taliban was responsible for any deaths during Saturday's violence: "It was the Afghan police that killed the innocent people of Kandahar while they were expressing their feeling against the burning of holy Quran in Florida."Kandahar is seen as a stronghold of the {w|Taliban insurgency} and in the last two months the province has seen several assassinations and suicide bombings.== Sources == 
[[FDA issues proposed rules requiring calorie content on menus]]The US {w|Food and Drug Administration} has issued proposed {w|calorie} labeling rules requiring most retail food vendors to display the calorie counts in items on their menus and menu boards. The proposed rules, issued Friday and expected to be finalized in 2012, would apply to most restaurants, snack bars, {w|vending machine}s, coffee shops, drive-through restaurants, and convenience and grocery stores.The US Congress required the rules in the health-care reform law  passed in 2010. The  rules proposed by the FDA must undergo a {w|public comment period} before they are finalized and take effect, said {w|Michael R. Taylor}, Deputy Director for Foods at the FDA.The proposed regulations pertain to businesses devoting more than 50 percent of their floor space to the sale of food or that consider themselves restaurants, specifically {w|Restaurant_chain#Restaurant_chains|food-selling chains} with at least 20 stores nationally. Included are candy stores, bakeries, and ice-cream parlors.The FDA's proposed guidelines specify that chains post the calorie counts of foods and drinks on menus and menu boards or next to the food item, such as at a salad bar. The menu is to prominently exhibit the calorie content of each item in a way customers can see easily, giving them the same information {w|packaged food}s prepared at home currently provide. The information must be displayed in "clear and conspicuous" print and colors.Many cities and states have passed {w|Calorie count laws|laws requiring calorie labeling on menus}, beginning with New York City in 2008. California implemented a similar law in January, although many counties are waiting for the release of the federal guidelines before they begin enforcement. Some {w|Fast food restaurant|fast-food} chains there, such as McDonald's and {w|Starbucks}, are displaying calorie counts on menus in some of their stores. The rules are intended to curb the {w|Epidemiology_of_obesity#United_States|national obesity epidemic} since, according to FDA estimates, one third of the calories people consume yearly come from food eaten out. In a statement issued yesterday, {w|Kathleen Sebelius}, {w|Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services} said, "Giving consumers clear nutritional information makes it easier for them to choose healthier options that can help fight obesity and make us all healthier." Excluded from the rules are businesses whose primary product is not food sales but that sell it, such as bowling alleys, airports and airplanes, amusement parks, hotels and movie theaters. Alcohol is also excluded.== Sources == 
[[Guatemalan president's divorce halted by court]]The divorce of Guatemalan president {w|?lvaro Colom|?lvaro Colom} and first lady {w|Sandra Torres|Sandra Torres} has been halted by a court after Torres said that she was divorcing her husband so she can run for president in the next election. The Guatemalan constitution bans the president's close relatives standing for office.A petition was taken to the court by a group of students, claiming the divorce is a "farce" that would bypass the constitution. {w|Otto Perez Molina}, the main opposition candidate, called the divorce {w|electoral fraud}. As first lady Torres has played a big role in politics during the presidency.Mildred Roca, the judge overseeing the couple's divorce hearing, reported receiving a threatening anonymous telephone call against granting the divorce. The caller described himself as from a "group defending the constitution". During the call he threatened to execute her family should the divorce be granted.President Colom has been married twice before and the first couple have been together for eight years.
[[Genetically modified dairy cows produce 'human milk']]A team from the China {W|China Agricultural University|Agricultural University} is reporting success after transferring human genes into a herd of 300 dairy cows. The cows now produce milk containing proteins associated with human breast milk.Human milk is beneficial to infants due to its high nutrient concentration. {W|Formula milk} offers an alternative to breastfeeding, but critics feel it is inferior and the research team hopes genetically modified cows could provide a solution. "Within 10 years, people will be able to pick up these products at the supermarket," claims Professor Ning Li, research leader and head of the university's State Key Laboratory for AgroBiotechnology. "We aim to commercialize some research in this area in coming three years."The new research, published in the journal {W|PLoS ONE|Public Library of Science One}, named three human proteins present in the cows' milk. {W|Lysozyme} protects babies from bacteria, {W|lactoferrin} boosts the cells in an infant's immune system and {W|alpha-lactalbumin} was also present. All are found in human breast milk."Our study describes transgenic cattle whose milk offers the similar nutritional benefits as human milk," Li wrote in the journal. "The modified bovine milk is a possible substitute for human milk. It fulfilled the conception of humanising the bovine milk." The cows are otherwise identical to normal cows and were produced by introducing the genes to cloned embryos, which were then reared by surrogate mothers.The laws surrounding genetically modified food research are tighter in Europe than China, but similar products have been sold legally in the United States for years. European consumers often avoid genetically modified foods, and therefore some supermarkets avoid stocking them.European campaigners are concerned about food safety and animal welfare; the Chinese team performed two studies on a total of 42 transgenic calves. Ten died soon after birth and six more did not survive beyond six months. It is not fully understood why survival and development is affected by cloning, which is used in the genetic modification process, but researchers concede it does happen.The {W|Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals}, a UK organisation, said it is "extremely concerned" by the development. A spokesperson for the organisation said: "Offspring of cloned animals often suffer health and welfare problems, so this would be a grave concern. Why do we need this milk ¡ª what is it giving us that we haven't already got?" A {W|University of Nottingham} professor specializing in genetic modification, Keith Campbell, rejected food safety concerns. "Genetically modified animals and plants are not going to be harmful unless you deliberately put in a gene that is going to be poisonous," he said. "Why would anyone do that in a food?" The Chinese team says cow welfare will be improved as they will be better able to fight udder infection with human proteins.== Sources == 
[[Serial killer sentenced to death in Swaziland]]A convicted {w|serial killer} has been {w|Capital punishment|sentenced to death} by {w|hanging} in the African country of Swaziland; his death will be the first execution in the country since 1983. David Simelane was sentenced to death by a judge nine days after being convicted of the murders of 28 people. Simelane's lawyers said they would appeal  the sentence and the verdict.Simelane's killing spree is believed to have begun in the late 1990s. He was arrested in 2001 after a tip off, after which he led police to the bodies of 45 people in various places in the country. The majority of the bodies were buried in shallow graves in the woods just outside the city of {w|Manzini}. Among the dead were several pregnant women.Several people reacted with joy when the news of the verdict was released. "He is not a person that should be let out into society ever, so it is right that he be hung," {w|women's rights} activist Mbali Dlamini said. "Now it is about the families¡ªnot David." The bodies of the victims can now be returned to relatives for burial; they had been held as evidence ever since the discovery.

[[New South Wales Premier criticised over government structure]]The newly-installed leader of New South Wales, Australia, has come in for harsh criticism on the structure of his government and cabinet. Coalition Premier Barry O'Farell swore in his cabinet on Sunday, but it has already been criticised for not including Ministers for Youth, Climate Change, or Volunteering. O'Farrell was also attacked by NSW {w|Australian Greens|Greens} MP Cate Faehrmann for dismembering the {w|Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water|Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water}. Ms Feahrmann told the {w|Sydney Morning Herald} the cuts were "laughable", and warned of "drastic cuts and a dramatic weakening of environmental protection standards and laws". NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson accused the new Premier of pandering to the {w|Shooters and Fishers Party}, telling the {w|Sydney Morning Herald} that the changes threatened environmental protection in NSW: "Former Labor premier Bob Carr established over 300 national parks in NSW and every one of those parks is now at risk," he said. O'Farrell had earlier announced responsibility for National Parks and the Environmental Protection Agency would be absorbed by his {w|Department of Premier and Cabinet|Department of Premier and Cabinet}.The {w|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC} reported Premier O'Farrell had denied the move would reduce his government's ability to manage environmental issues. The Premier is quoted as saying: "People need to reserve judgement until they see the way in which we operate rather than simply react to the hysterical claims". O'Farrell's {w|Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal}-led Coalition swept to power on March 26, 2011 after sixteen years of {w|Australian Labor Party|Labor} rule in NSW. They have 66 seats in the {w|NSW Legislative Assembly}, to Labor's 20.== Sources == 
[[Barack Obama announces 2012 re-election bid]]US President Barack Obama has released details on his plan to run for re-election next year. A video was released on Obama's official website and e-mails sent to supporters. The announced plan to run for a second term was widely expected; the campaign team are expected to file for election papers later this week.In his e-mail to supporters Obama says, "[w]e're doing this now because the politics we believe in does not start with expensive TV ads or extravaganzas, but with you ¡ª with people organizing block-by-block, talking to neighbors, co-workers, and friends. And that kind of campaign takes time to build."The president also revealed a new look for his website stating, "[t]he idea is to improve upon what's worked for the past four years, scrap what hasn't, and build a campaign that reflects the thoughts and experiences of the supporters who've powered this movement."The November 2012 election is 20 months away. Several {w|US Republican Party|Republican} candidates hope to receive the nomination to stand against Obama but so far only one, former governor of Minnesota {w|Tim Pawlenty}, has made an official bid.During the first term of his presidency Obama has seen his popularity drop with conflicts in the Middle East and Africa as well as the economic climate back home. In 2012 the unemployment rate in the United States is projected to stand at 8.3%. Although this is lower than the current 8.8%, no president since World War II has been re-elected with an unemployment figure above 7.5%.
[[UN attacks Gbagbo military positions in Ivory Coast]]A spokesman for the United Nations has announced that UN helicopters attacked an encampment of President Laurent Gbagbo's fighters in Ivory Coast to stop the use of heavy weapons and shelling of civilians."We launched an operation to neutralise heavy weapons Gbagbo's special forces have been using against the civilian population for the last three months. We destroyed them in four locations", said spokesman Hamadoun Toure in an email. In concert with the UN, France has deployed an additional 350 peacekeepers to compliment its 7,500 troops already in the country. It was also reported that the French were in control of the airport in Abidjan.The recent violence in Ivory Coast stems from Gbagbo's refusal to accept his loss in  the recent presidential elections. He has  stated that he will not transfer power to his  successor Alassane Ouattara, the declared winner. Gbagbo's spokesman, Abdon George Bayeto, told the BBC the elections were rigged as an "international plot against the incumbent" and was going to continue fighting forces loyal to Ouattara.Lieutenant Jean-Marc Tago of the Ivory Coast army announced the return of {w|Philippe Mangou|General Phillippe Mangou}. Although it has been reported that the general's family was being held hostage by Gbagbo forces,  Tago claims this is untrue, saying, "The general is with us, and has always been with us. Our plan is to defend the institutions of the republic against all its enemies, against the rebels, against the mercenaries, against the [United Nations] and all those who are attacking the institutions of the republic commanded by President Laurent Gbagbo."British foreign secretary William Hague said in a statement, "We call for an end to the violence, for defeated former president Gbagbo to step down, for all human rights abuses to be investigated, and for the International Criminal Court to investigate the crimes which appear to have taken place."The crisis has created a humanitarian problem as one million of Abidjan's four million people has been displaced.== Sources == 
[[UN attack Gbagbo camp in Ivory Coast]]They don't really care about the burning incident. They have plenty of real things to be mad about, and the Qur'an burning just became a rallying point that the US government can't touch lest it appear to be intolerant.Even if this were really about a Qur'an being burned, then the problem is the violent reaction to something that is completely pointless and harmless. It's not wrong to burn paper with ink on it. It's not like an invaluable, historical artifact was destroyed in some ancient library; there are probably billions of copies of the Qur'an.
[[Serial killer suspected loose in New York, more bodies found]]Police in {w|Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County}, New York suspect that a serial killer may be on the loose in the area, following the discovery of eight bodies on beaches near the New York City area since December 2010. The latest discovery of three corpses was made by investigators on {w|Gilgo Beach}, which is a {w|barrier island} south of {w|Long Island} about 45 miles east of New York. The corpses were located in an area of "dense brush".Four of the eight bodies located so far along a highway near the beach have been identified as prostitutes who had arranged meetings with clients via the internet, over services such as {w|Craigslist}; victim number five, whose body was found last week, has not yet been formally identified. Police forensics officers took a month to discover who the first four victims were, using dental records and DNA sampling.Police are remaining cautious over the latest batch of three, saying that they have yet to officially connect this find with the previous five corpses.According to Suffolk County's Police Commissioner, Richard Dormer, the latest three sets of remains were found by officers on foot and via an air search as they scoured tick-infested underbrush and evergreens. The remains of the new victims were found about 500 metres apart.During the investigations, police have also been focusing on the disappearance of a prostitute from New Jersey, Shannan Gilbert. She was last seen in the {w|Oak Beach, New York|Oak Beach}, New York area in May 2010, where she had arranged to meet a client. A witness in a gated community claims that a woman he suspects to be Gilbert came to the door of his house around 4.45pm on May 1 last year, begging for help. She fled when he tried to call the police.DNA testing however, has determined that the fifth body is not Gilbert's.A thorough search is continuing in the area, Commissioner Dormer said, using all available methods ranging from cadaver dogs, police academy cadets and detectives through to volunteer firefighters.== Sources == 
[[Disputed Ivory Coast president Gbagbo negotiating surrender]]The United Nations has announced that three Ivory Coast military leaders are in the process of negotiating a potential surrender for disputed president Laurent Gbagbo.After several days of fighting, during which forces loyal to internationally-recognized president Alassane Ouattara moved south towards the city of Abidjan, Gbagbo is reported to have taken shelter in a bunker underneath the presidential palace in Abidjan.  Pro-Ouattara forces are reported to have surrounded the palace.According to the UN and French officials, an agreement that would see Gbagbo relinquish power is close to being finalized. Military forces loyal to Gbagbo have already declared a ceasefire.  According to France's foreign minister, {w|Alain Juppe}, "[w]e are very close to convincing him [Gbagbo] to leave power."The military officials involved ¡ª the heads of the army, police and guard forces ¡ª are reported to be requesting guarantees of safety in return for Gbagbo's surrender.  A Gbagbo spokesperson, Ahoua Don Mello, said that "direct negotiations based on African Union recommendations" had taken place, though Gbabgo himself said that "on a political level, no decision has yet been taken."== Sources == 
[[Wreckage, victims of Air France Flight 447 found]]After an exhaustive two year, 20 million euro search, the final resting spot of {w|Air France Flight 447} has been located. The location of the wreckage is six miles north of the plane's last reported position off the coast of Brazil at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters.The wreckage of the {w|Airbus A330-200}, was found Sunday by a team from the {w|Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution}, using a Remus robotic submarine and its {w|side-scan sonar}. After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage."We weren¡¯t prepared for that. We are now confronted with another trauma," Robert Soulas, vice president of Entraide et Solidarit¨¦ AF447, a support group for families of victims of the crash, said. Soulas lost his daughter and son-in-law, who were on board the flight when it crashed. "For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."The remains of the plane, which were concentrated in a 600 metres by 200 metres area, appear to be relatively intact which leads investigators to believe that the plane hit the water intact and did not explode mid-air. Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009.According to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's {w|Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety}, the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation. The salvage operation, which will cost around 5 million euros according to estimates, will be financed by the French government. Three salvage companies who are bidding to recover the wreck have until afternoon on Thursday to submit proposals. The operation should take between three weeks to a month.On raising the remains of the plane Troadec said: "We want to know what happened in this accident, most particularly so it never happens again." Some family members agreed saying such as Michael Gaignard, whose sister was on board the plane said, "We want to know what happened in that plane." An attorney for several families said some had yet to come to terms with loss of loved ones, saying "There's been no burial, no goodbye ... just lots and lots of suffering."Soulas of Entraide et Solidarit¨¦ AF447 disagreed. "There's a very traumatic side to this and it causes problems of identification. We don't know what state they are in." He added, "And it risks causing a dispute between families who want to leave the bodies at the bottom of the Atlantic and those who want them brought to the surface."However, despite the discovery of the wreckage, the plane's two {w|flight recorders}, the {w|flight data recorder} and the {w|cockpit voice recorder} have yet to be found at the crash site.Alain Bouillard, who is in charge of BEA's recovery effort said, "It's still a jigsaw puzzle. We do not know where the recorders might be."There are concerns that the two-year length the recorders have been submerged in seawater along with enormous pressure located at the depth of the wreck, that the data on the recorders might be unreadable. Bouillard said it is possible the recorders were damaged, but had "great confidence" in their robustness.Without the recovery of the recorders, investigators may be unable to determine the cause of the crash. The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's {w|pitot tubes}, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is travelling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash.The plane's {w|Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System} sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.== Sources == 
[[ACLU, EFF challenging US 'secret' court orders seeking Twitter data]]Late last month, the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation filed objections to the United States Government's 'secret' attempts to obtain Twitter account information relating to WikiLeaks. The ACLU and EFF cite First and Fourth amendment issues as overriding reasons to overturn government attempts to keep their investigation secret; and, that with {w|Birgitta Jonsdottir} being an Icelandic Parliamentarian, the issue has serious international implications.The case, titled "In the Matter of the 2703 Order Relating to Twitter Accounts: Wikileaks, Rop_G, IOERROR; and BirgittaJ", has been in the EFF's sights since late last year when they became aware of the US government's attempts to investigate WikiLeaks-related communications using the popular microblogging service.The key objective of this US government investigation is to obtain data for the prosecution of {w|Bradley Manning}, alleged to have supplied classified data to WikiLeaks. In addition to Manning's Twitter account, and that of WikiLeaks, the following three accounts are subject to the order: @ioerror, @birgittaj, and @rop_g. These, respectively, belong to Jacob Apelbaum, Birgitta Jonsdottir, and {w|Rop Gonggrijp}.Birgitta is not the only non-US citizen with their Twitter account targetted by the US Government; Gonggrijp, a Dutch 'ex-hacker'-turned-security-expert, was one of the founders of {w|XS4ALL} ¨C the first {w|Internet Service Provider} in the Netherlands available to the public. He has worked on a mobile phone that can encrypt conversations, and proven that electronic voting systems can readily be hacked.In early March, a Virginia magistrate judge ruled that the government could have the sought records, and neither the targetted users, or the public, could see documents submitted to justify data being passed to the government. The data sought is as follows:The order demands disclosure of absolutely all such data from November 1, 2009 for the targetted accounts.The ACLU and EFF are not only challenging this, but demanding that all submissions made by the US government to justify the Twitter disclosure are made public, plus details of any other such cases which have been processed in secret.Bradley Manning, at the time a specialist from Maryland enlisted with the United States Army's 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, was arrested in June last year in connection with the leaking of classified combat video to WikiLeaks.The leaked video footage, taken from a US helicopter gunship, showed the deaths of Reuters staff {w|Saeed Chmagh} and {w|Namir Noor-Eldeen} during a U.S. assault in Baghdad, Iraq. The wire agency unsuccessfully attempted to get the footage released via a {w|Freedom of Information Act} request in 2007.When WikiLeaks released the video footage it directly contradicted the official line taken by the U.S. Army asserting that the deaths of the two Reuters staff were "collateral damage" in an attack on Iraqi insurgents. The radio chatter associated with the {w|AH-64 Apache} video indicated the helicopter crews had mistakenly identified the journalists' equipment as weaponry.The US government also claims Manning is linked to CableGate; the passing of around a quarter of a million classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. Manning has been in detention since July last year; in December allegations of torture were made to the United Nations {w|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|High Commissioner for Human Rights} regarding the conditions under which he was and is being detained.Reports last month that he must now sleep naked and attend role call at the U.S. Marine facility in {w|Quantico, Virginia|Quantico} in the same state, raised further concern over his detention conditions. {w|Philip J. Crowley}, at-the-time a State Department spokesman, remarked on this whilst speaking at {w|Massachusetts Institute of Technology}; describing the current treatment of Manning as "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid", Crowley was, as a consequence, put in the position of having to tender his resignation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Despite his native Australia finding, in December last year, that Assange's WikiLeaks had not committed any criminal offences in their jurisdiction, the U.S. government has continued to make ongoing operations very difficult for the whistleblower website.The result of the Australian Federal Police investigation left the country's Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, having to retract a statement that Wikileaks had acted "illegally"; instead, she characterised the site's actions as "grossly irresponsible".Even with Australia finding no illegal activity on the part of WikiLeaks, and with founder Julian Assange facing extradition to Sweden, U.S. pressure sought to hobble WikiLeaks financially.Based on a State Department letter, online payments site PayPal suspended WikiLeaks account in December. Their action was swiftly followed by Visa Europe and Mastercard ceasing to handle payments for WikiLeaks.The online processing company, Datacell, threatened the two credit card giants with legal action over this. However, avenues of funding for the site were further curtailed when both {w|Amazon.com} and Swiss bank PostFinance joined the financial boycott of WikiLeaks.Assange continues, to this day, to argue that his extradition to Sweden for questioning on alleged sexual offences is being orchestrated by the U.S. in an effort to discredit him, and thus WikiLeaks.Wikinews consulted an IT and cryptography expert from the Belgian university which developed the current {w|Advanced Encryption Standard}; explaining modern communications, he stated: "Cryptography has developed to such a level that intercepting communications is no longer cost effective. That is, if any user uses the correct default settings, and makes sure that he/she is really connecting to Twitter it is highly unlikely that even the {w|National Security Agency|NSA} can break the cryptography for a protocol such as SSL/TLS."Qualifying this, he commented that "the vulnerable parts of the communication are the end points." To make his point, he cited the following quote from {w|Gene Spafford}: "Using encryption on the Internet is the equivalent of arranging an armored car to deliver credit card information from someone living in a cardboard box to someone living on a park bench."Continuing, the {w|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven} expert explained:Wikinews also consulted French IT security researcher Stevens Le Blond on the issues surrounding the case, and the state-of-the-art in monitoring, and analysing, communications online. Le Blond, currently presenting a research paper on attacks on {w|Tor} to {w|USENIX} audiences in North America, responded via email:Having been alerted to the ongoing case through a joint press release by the ACLU and EFF, Wikinews sought clarification on the primary issues which the two non-profits saw as particularly important in challenging the U.S. Government over the 'secret' court orders. Rebecca Jeschke, Media Relations Director for the EFF, explained in more detail the points crucial to them, responding to a few questions from Wikinews on the case:Finally, Wikinews approached the Icelandic politician, and WikiLeaks supporter, who has made this specific case a landmark in how the U.S. Government handles dealings with ¨C supposedly ¨C friendly governments and their elected representatives. A number of questions were posed, seeking the Icelandic Parliamentarian's views:I don't support radical transparency ¨C I understand that some things need to remain secret. It is the process of making things secret that needs to be both more transparent and in better consensus with nations.The U.S. Government continues to have issues internationally as a result of material passed to WikiLeaks, and subsequently published.Within the past week, Ecuador has effectively declared the U.S. ambassador {w|Heather Hodges} persona-non-grata over corruption allegations brought to light in leaked cables. Asking the veteran diplomat to leave "as soon as possible", the country may become the third in South America with no ambassadorial presence. Both Venezuela and Bolivia have no resident U.S. ambassador due to the two left-wing administrations believing the ejected diplomats were working with the opposition.The U.S. State Department has cautioned Ecuador that a failure to speedily normalise diplomatic relations may jeapordise ongoing trade talks.The United Kingdom is expected to press the Obama administration over the continuing detention of 23-year-old Manning, who also holds UK citizenship.

[[Indian activist begins "fast-unto-death" hunger strike to end corruption]]Indian social activist and reformer {w|Anna Hazare}, 72, joined a nationwide  protest campaign against an anti-corruption bill on Tuesday  by beginning  a "fast-unto-death" {w|hunger strike} at  {w|Jantar Mantar|Jantar Mantar} observatory in Delhi. He and 100 of his supporters began fasting to protest the bill, known as the  Ombudsman bill, when  the government did not accept their demand  that the opinions of citizens be considered in the formation of the bill.Participants in the nationwide  campaign called "{w|India Against Corruption}"  claim the proposed  anti-corruption  bill is too weak because the {w|ombudsman} is given no enforcement mechanisms and lacks wide investigative powers. Their goal is  to strengthen the bill and  give it teeth. They seek to create a citizen ombudsman free from political influence, that would accept citizen input, and could investigate charges against public officials including the prime minister¡¯s office. "I have written so many letters to the prime minister asking for time to meet and discuss. No reply," said Hazare. "Everybody is drowned in corruption. I will fast until I die for the cause of cleaning up the system."Corruption is an entrenched feature of life in India, from  minor fees paid to avoid trumped up charges to massive fraudulent scams by government officials. A recent string of  high-profile  allegations of corruption  have shaken financial confidence in India's economy, the third largest in Asia.The series of costly  corruption scandals in the past six months have resulted in  enormous public outrage that has embarrassed the government of  {w|Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh},  including {w|Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|problems in funding the 2010} Commonwealth Games, {w|2G spectrum scam|a multi-billion telecom licensing scam} involving a cabinet minister, and a {w|Adarsh Housing Society Scam|land fraud scheme}   in which  bureaucrats appropriated  apartments intended  for war widows in Mumbai.Although hunger strikes are a common political tactic in India,  millions of Indians have joined the recent anti-corruption campaign. Supporters of Hazare have crowed Jantar Mantar observatory where Hazare has completed  his third day of  fasting.  More than 80,000 friends have joined his Facebook page. The Ombudsman bill was first drafted 42 years ago, but has never been passed by parliament in the 10 times it has been proposed.
[[Britain touts private security contractors for Libya]]Britain has raised the idea of using private security firms as part of efforts to bolster military support for Libyan rebels. Defence officials speaking to {w|The Guardian} have floated the idea as Western powers examine ways to turn the tide of the rebels' stuttering campaign against forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. The sources also urged Arab countries to fund training for the rebels, whose inferior weaponry and organisation is widely agreed to have allowed pro-Gaddafi forces to check the insurgency's recent gains.The call to deploy private security contractors comes as the Afghan government has announced plans to phase out such operators over the next 12 months. The image of such firms has been severely tarnished by repeated revelations of abuse by the U.S. firm {w|Blackwater Worldwide}, subsequently renamed Xe Services. Blackwater executives and employees have faced civil lawsuits, criminal charges and Congressional investigations related to accusations of bribery and murder in Iraq and Afghanistan. The collapse of numerous investigations related to several alleged incidents has raised questions about the legal accountability of firms operating in war zones on behalf of Western governments.The suggested training of rebels and deployment of contractors appears to confirm Western powers' determination to end Gaddafi's grip on power. Yesterday's report in The Guardian interprets the move as the start of a new phase in the three-week-old NATO-led intervention in Libya, and a tacit admission by Western nations that the rebels are struggling to make ground despite NATO air support. Britain's focus on Arab participation in funding and training the rebels reflects a will on Western powers' part to foster Arab ownership of the intervention, perceived as being crucial to building the legitimacy of the West's support to Libyan rebels.According to The Guardian, Western military strategy is now turning to cementing the rebels' territorial gains before the negotiation of a ceasefire with the Gaddafi regime.== Sources == 
[[Australian opposition may oppose plain packaging on cigarettes]]Australian Health Minister {w|Nicola Roxon} has announced plans to introduce legislation requiring cigarette packaging to be plain, and unbranded. The {w|Coalition|opposition coalition} may oppose this move, and will examine the detail of the legislation before deciding."We do support sensible measures that are proven to lead to reduced levels of smoking but we want to wait and see the full legislation, and what evidence they are relying on that plain packaging does reduce smoking rates," stated a spokesman for opposition leader Tony Abbott.Intended to decrease the number of Australians smoking, the new packaging is to be olive in colour with no logos or branding, and larger  health warnings similar to those currently embossed on packaging."The new packs have been designed to have the lowest appeal to smokers and to make clear the terrible effects that smoking can have on your health," said Roxon in an official statement.Cigarette conglomerate {w|British American Tobacco|British American Tobacco Australia} insists the proposed legislation to require plain package cigarettes is an infringement of international trademark and intellectual property laws that could cost Australian taxpayers millions in legal fees alone.If the legislation passes the new law would begin to be phased in from January next year. With the new measures Australia will lead the world on tobacco control; several other countries, including New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Canada, are reportedly watching the situation in Australia before implementing similar legislation.== Sources == 
[[Mother charged with hurting baby; Munchausen Syndrome by proxy?]]Tucson, Arizona police say that Blanca Montano, 21, an Arizona mother, was arrested and charged with child abuse on Tuesday for purposely injuring her seven-month-old daughter. Hospital staff reported Montano to authorities after the child was found to be suffering from nine separate, rare infections which became worse after the mother's visits.Investigation by police determined that Montano had knowingly poisoned her child and made her sick. Montano was then prevented from visiting and the child noticeably improved.Montano hospitalized her two children at  {w|University Medical Center|University Medical Center in Tucson} in February where they were diagnosed and treated for an infection. While one child improved and was released, her infant daughter became increasingly sick and was significantly worse following visits from her mother. Suspecting that  the mother was  exhibiting symptoms of a rare condition known as  {w|Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy},  in which a mother intentionally harms her  child to obtain attention or sympathy for herself, hospital officials contacted police and set up a hidden camera in the infant's room.Police say that when the mother realized that there was a camera in the hospital room, she covered the child's crib with a towel.Dr Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist at the {w|University of Alabama}, says that Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is not a {w|Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder}. "It is not a mental illness. It is a form of abuse, just like sexual abuse, physical abuse and emotional abuse ¨C it's just a variant," he said.Montano is out on $50,000 bail and will next appear in court on April 15.== Sources == 
[[Body of missing student found in Bath, England]]A body that was discovered in the {w|River Avon|River Avon} in {w|Bath, Somerset|Bath} has been confirmed as missing student James Bubear. The 19 year-old went missing on March 13 after leaving a fancy dress party in the city centre. The creative writing student's death is not being treated as suspicious according to the {w|Avon and Somerset police}.The {w|Bath University} student went missing after attending a night out with friends. He left the Revolution bar around 10.30pm and was last seen on CCTV James Street West  on the night of his disapperence. His passport and phone was found the next morning by a street cleaner.Bubear's mother, Vanda released a statement saying "We would like to thank James's fellow students and the people of Bath for taking him as one of their own, and for the support they have given us in these last few difficult weeks. I would also like to thank them for their perseverance in trying to find James. Nothing seemed like it was too much trouble, and for that I am indebted to them."Concerns have been raised about the saftey on the River Avon in Bath. Marion Flagg's son Casper's body was found in the River Avon on Boxing Day in 2009. She said "It would be nice to see better lighting and to identify where blackspots are," she said. Perhaps we could have railings because there's nothing to stop you from walking straight from the Midland Bridge into the water. It's just a sheer drop and it's very dark."
[[U.S. budget crisis will cause personal budget crisis for U.S. troops]]According to senior defense officials, U.S. service men and women around the world, including those at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, may receive only one-week's pay instead of two in their next paycheck if the government shuts down this weekend due to the federal budget impasse.The military can't be paid during a funding lapse until a new appropriations bill or continuing resolution is passed by Congress.If the funding bill is allowed to expire on April 8, it will be in the middle of a standard military two-week pay period, so {w|the Pentagon} would likely send out paychecks for just the first week of the pay period, and not the second, leaving many service members strapped for cash for the remainder of the month.Historically, workers such as the military who are legally obligated to work during a shutdown, do eventually receive back pay for it. But that doesn't help pay bills that are due presently.Additional details on the military's plan for funding during a potential shutdown are expected in the next day or so.Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said earlier Tuesday that department leaders hadn't figured out how pay would be affected for the military, including the 146,000 servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan.Morrell said the Pentagon would continue key national security responsibilities including fighting the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and continuing operations in Libya and earthquake assistance to Japan.The likelihood of a shutdown continues to increase, and President Obama continues to reject a Republican measure that would fund the government for another week but cut $12 billion from the budget.== Sources == 
[[Train crash in Netanya, Israel injures at least 50; no casualties]]Over 50 people have been injured today when two trains collided head-on at the Bet-Yehoshua station, near the city of Netanya on the railway from {w|Tel Aviv} to {w|Haifa}. Most of the injuries are minor, with no casualties or serious injuries reported in the media.The trains advanced slowly, one leaving the station and one entering it. One of the trains was completely derailed. The Israeli Railway Authority CEO said the accident was caused by a personal error of one of the conductors, but a police investigation is still ensuing. This is the second serious accident for Israeli trains within half a year. Four months ago, a train car derailed and burst in flames, injuring 79 people, most of the injuries due to inhaling of smoke. The Israel Railway Authority notified the passengers that the tracks from Tel Aviv to Haifa will be closed for at least a week, but later the company manager announced that rides would continue within 24 hours, while a fast and open investigation will follow. He promised that the results will be publicized immediately upon being received. == Sources == 
[[At least fourteen dead after eating toxic fish in Madagascar]]At least fourteen people have died after eating {w|toxic} {w|sardine|sardines} in Madagascar. The deaths occurred in the town of {w|Toliara}, with another similar situation happening 130 km away in {w|Sakaraha}. The sardines the victims ate belong to the {w|Clupeidae} family. As well as the dead, around 120 people have been taken ill after eating the fish according to officials.Dr {w|Hery Raharisaina}, Madagascar's fishing and aquatic resources minister, offered condolence to the families of the victims on behalf of the government. He added in his statement that the government would pay for the medical bills for those who are still hospitalized from the toxic fish and would also supply 100 mattresses to the city of Toliara, as the region's hospital is overcrowded.Samples of the sardines have been sent to health officials at the {w|Institut Pasteur de Madagascar} in the capital city of {w|Antananarivo}. Incidents like this have happened before in which researchers have tracked the cause down to the fish eating poisonous seaweed. Madagascar has the third biggest coral system in the world.
[[Twelve dead at Brazilian school after man opens fire]]Twelve people died during a shooting at a school in the neighborhood {w|Realengo} in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. The gunman is numbered among the dead, after taking his own life. Ten people are reported injured during the attack by a man identified as Wellington Menezes Olivera, a 23 year old ex-student from the school.The attack took place just after 8am local time this morning. Television station {w|TV Globo} reported that Olivera entered the Tasso da Silveira municipal school, telling officials that he was attending to make a speech to students. He was reportedly carrying at least two revolvers and a significant amount of ammunition.Witnesses state that he began to fire at pupils' heads, killing ten girls and one boy. Rio state health secretary, {w|Sergio Cortes}, stated that those injured in the attack were taken to local hospitals. At least four were said to be in a "grave" condition.Rio's Police chief, Martha Rocha, said in a press conference that the gunman had no previous criminal history. She stated that he was carrying 2 firearms, although she did not specify what type. During the attack he fired off at least 30 rounds of ammunition. There were approximately 400 people in the school when the attack began, and shortly after the shooting started, two small boys outside the school, one with a gunshot wound, ran almost two city blocks until they found police and alerted them to the incident.The two officers who were made aware ran to the school, and quickly managed to locate the gunman, leading to a shooting match. One officer, Marcio Alves, stated that "He saw me and aimed a gun at me, I shot him in the legs, he fell down the stairs and then shot himself in the head."Police report that Olivera was carrying a "long and rambling" letter, confirming his intentions to commit suicide.  In a statement by the Mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, he made it clear that life at the school had become a "hellish nightmare." Authorities closed the school temporarily while they investigate, but Mayor Paes confirmed that the school will reopen.The fate of all the children in the school is not yet known. One eleven year old pupil from the school, Wanderson Barbosa, was interviewed by Associated Press as he sat on the steps of his house. He was in his classroom when the attack started, and he and others in his class thought that other students were fighting, until his teacher told them to get to the floor, because it was gunfire. "I'm so worried," Barbosa said to reporters, "We don't have news of everyone yet."Meanwhile, Rio's Governor, {w|Sergio Cabral}, called the attacker a "psychopath", whilst indicating that he does not believe anyone else was involved in the attack, but that investigations into the incident will continue.== Sources == 
[[Bailout signals Lisbon's capitulation to financial markets]]Having resisted financial-market pressure for months, Portugal has finally requested an International Monetary Fund and European Union bailout. The emergency loan, believed to total around 75 billion euros, comes three weeks after the country¡¯s prime minister, {w|Jos¨¦ S¨®crates}, resigned following parliamentary rejection of his government¡¯s proposed austerity measures.Following recent sovereign debt crises in Greece and then Ireland, the Portuguese government¡¯s actions have attracted harsh criticism in the European press. Applauding the request for foreign assistance, Britain¡¯s The Guardian nonetheless lambasts Mr S¨®crates for the tardiness of his decision. The British newspaper described Portugal as ¡°the financial-market equivalent of a dead man walking¡± in an editorial dated April 7.In Portugal, P¨²blico observed that ¡°it will not be easy to accept more austerity, but it will be impossible to accept any more demagoguery, denial of reality, political incompetence or irresponsibility¡±. The National Daily noted, however, that the ¡°return of the IMF represents a stinging defeat for Portugal¡±. Indeed, the political intransigence since Mr S¨®crates¡¯s resignation on March 23 was widely viewed as doomed to failure from the outset. The Portguese request, pointed out Spain¡¯s El Pa¨ªs, ¡°surprised no-one, but [had] been delayed for political reasons¡±.These latest developments will no doubt fuel further criticism of the single currency. In Austria, Vienna¡¯s Der Standard labelled the euro a ¡°deceitful entity¡±, mocking the claim by European leaders that ¡°States bailed out using taxpayers¡¯ money will be able to repay their debts with restructuring¡±.There have been widespread claims that a will to protect the euro has led Brussels to unduly downplay the gravity of the sovereign debt crisis sweeping the continent.The emergency loan is expected to be delivered before Portuguese elections on June 5. == Sources ==

The Dr Strangelove scenario. The BBC pointed out that the US, the French and the Russians were not willing to take such a risk, and placed PAL locks on all their submarines. However the MoD response was that British submarine did not need PAL locks because:.... and HMS Astute may not carry nuclear weapons, however it is crewed by men of the same calibre as found elsewhere in the submarine service, and on this occasion the crew certainly did not spot a rogue element within the crew, nor did they deal with him until after the shooting was over.An abridged version of the BBC2 Newsnight report can be viewed online here 109.148.29.88 19:57, 8 April 2011

[[White farmer who beat Mugabe in court over land seizures, dies]]The Zimbabwean farmer who took Robert Mugabe to court over the seisure of land from white farmers, {w|Mike Campbell|Mike Campbell}, has died at the age of 78.  It is claimed by his family that Mr. Campbell never fully recovered after being kidnapped and severely beaten by Zimbabwean militants.The Southern Africa correspondent for the BBC, Karen Allen, said that Mr. Campbell became "one of the most well known names in the white farming community in Zimbabwe."His struggle through the courts was captured in an award winning documentary, {w|Mugabe and the White African}, although his win in the regional courts was subsequently ignored by Mugabe, whose policy of land removal continued, along with the intimidation of residents and workers on white owned farms.Campbell and some members of his family were kidnapped in mid 2008, and taken to a military camp where they were severely beaten, before being made to sign legal documents stating that they would drop the case against Mugabe.  However, the case went ahead, and in November of the same year, the regional {w|Southern African Development Community|SADC} tribunal ruled that the land seizures were against the law, and directed the Zimbabwean government to protect the rights of the landowners in Zimbabwe.Mugabe refused however, and stated that he and {w|Zimbabwe African National Union ¨C Patriotic Front|Zanu-PF} militants would continue to take land from white farmers, since the policy of land reform was a core policy and "could not be reversed."Even today, out of an estimated 4,000 white owned farms, only 300 still remain and the evictions continue.Mr. Campbell suffered health issues after being attacked, losing certain mental functions including calculation.  After the seizure of his property, he went to {w|Harare}, and it is here that he died on Wednesday, homeless.  His own home on the land he'd owned, burned to the ground in front of him by supporters of the Zanu-PF party. == Sources ==

[[Nitrite poisoned milk kills three babies, sickens 35 in China]]At least 35 people, mostly young children, have become ill and three babies died in {w|Pingliang} city in Northwest China, after consuming contaminated milk.Preliminary investigations have shown that the victims died from {w|nitrite} poisoning after drinking milk supplied from a local dairy farm. According to a local government statement, two dairy farms have been shut down and are currently being investigated. Nitrite is usually used in dyes and to cure meats. In an effort to clean up the dairy industry, the government shut down nearly 1,200 dairy farms last week.According to {w|China Daily}, local police detained a suspect in his 40s who is believed to have produced and supplied the tainted milk. The suspect is an independent dairy farmer who has sold homemade dairy products for many years, said a public official from the local government who requested to remain anonymous. "The man thought that he had been wronged and insisted that he was unaware of what had happened to his farm and milk," the official said to China Daily. It remains unclear whether the poisoning was a crime or an accident, resulting from improperly storing the milk. According to a Friday press release from the city government and local health bureau, the 35 people who fell ill by consuming the milk are being treated in two hospitals in Pingliang. Most patients are children under fourteen years of age. One patient is in a critical condition, but the conditions of the other patients are reported to be stable. This is the second food contamination incident to occur in within a month. In March, China's largest meat processor apologized after the illegal additive {w|clenbuterol} was found in some of their pork products.

Now there may be an asterisk after his record numbers."His numbers, he was unreal," said Red Sox infielder {w|Omar Vizquel}, who was Ramirez's teammate with the {w|Cleveland Indians}. "He was one of the most feared guys with runners in scoring position. ... If there is a guy you really want at the plate in a tough situation, it would have been Manny."Ramirez's retirement coincides with the trial of another of baseball's great hitters, {w|Barry Bonds}, charged with  falsely denying to a grand jury that he used performance-enhancing drugs. "Until the past couple of years, I thought [Ramirez] was on his way to the {w|National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame}," said {w|Texas Rangers} manager {w|Ron Washington}. "I don't think many guys got as many big hits in their careers as he has. There weren't many guys who had as big an effect on a game as he had.

[[Guatemalan president and first lady granted divorce]]President {w|Alvaro Colom} of Guatemala and first lady {w|Sandra Torres|Sandra Torres} has been granted a divorce by a family court. The couple applied for a divorce so that Torres could stand for president when her husband steps down. The couple would have to divorce because of the Guatemalan {w|constitution} which states that close relatives of the president can not stand to be their successor.Judge Mildred Roca said that she reached her decision to grant the couple a divorce last week, but had to delay making it official until other motions were ruled upon challenging the divorce. According to a spokesman from the {w|Supreme Court}, the judge was able to dismiss all objections as and ill-advised or "frivolous".The divorce has been meet with criticism from the public and opposition politicians. The couple has been accused of "legal fraud" and {w|Otto Perez Molina}, the main opposition candidate, still believes that if Torres runs for office it would still violate the constitution. Perez is the current front runner in the opinion polls with 47.2% while Torres is believed to have 13.7%.
[[Nigeria votes in parliamentary elections]]Voting in parliamentary elections that took place on Saturday in Nigeria has concluded and votes are being counted after the first part of a three-round election.The day of voting passed fairly peacefully, with only two instances of violence.  In {w|Maiduguri}, at least three people were killed after a bomb went off, and a hotel in the city was set on fire. Elsewhere, a policeman was shot and killed in {w|Borno State}. On Friday, a bombing in {w|Suleja} killed between eight and ten people.The elections were postponed for a week after many ballots and other voting materials were missing or incomplete in some regions. The difficulties were not apparent until voting had begun, and the country's Electoral Commission chose to push the date of the parliamentary elections back a week.Saturday's elections were for 360 seats in the {w|House of Representatives of Nigeria|House of Representatives} and 109 seats in the {w|Senate of Nigeria|Senate}.  Next Saturday, presidential elections will take place, and a week from then are elections for state governors.Current president Goodluck Jonathan is expected to win the presidential election, though his {w|People's Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party} appears likely to suffer a reduction of its majority in the {w|National Assembly of Nigeria|National Assembly}, which is composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate.According to the Electoral Commission, the elections are a "test of honour [that]is inescapably a collective one for all Nigerians. "It is our national honour at stake, and our relevance in the affairs of the modern world being redefined."== Sources ==

[[Investigation launched after small aircraft crashes on Philippines mountain, killing two]]An investigation is tonight underway after a {w|light aircraft} crashed into a popular mountain resort in the Philippines city of Baguio, killing two aboard, and injuring four others. The aircraft, which may have been trying to make an {w|emergency landing}, narrowly missed crashing into a tourist resort where a crowd had gathered.Witnesses said the six-seater {w|Piper Aztec} aircraft was flying very low before it clipped pine trees and impacted with the ground, bursting into flames. The crash happened just minutes after it lifted off from {w|Loakan Airport}. One person aboard the aircraft was killed instantly, and the four others were taken to hospital where another died. No-one on the ground was hurt in the accident.Police confirmed the aircraft crashed into a {w|mountain trail} and exploded. Wikinews understands {w|air traffic control|air traffic controllers} lost contact with the pilot shortly after takeoff, and officials say the aircraft may have suffered technical problems. Police told journalists the pilot might have been attempting to make an emergency landing in an open area but struck trees.== Sources == 
[[Mubarak summoned by Egyptian prosecutors to face allegations of killings and corruption]]Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president {w|Resignation of Hosni Mubarak|ousted} in February after massive demonstrations, has been summoned by officials in the country to face questions about corruption within his administration and allegations he ordered his forces to kill activists protesting against him. The news came hours after Mubarak announced he would cooperate with the investigation into corruption within his regime, and said he would robustly defend himself against what he termed an "unjust" campaign of "distortions, lies and incitement" against him. He made the comments in his first appearance since he was ousted from office.His two sons have also been summoned by Egyptian prosecutors to answer to allegations of {w|embezzlement} of public funds during Mubarak's rule. This afternoon, the former prime minister of Egypt, {w|Ahmed Nazif}, was taken into custody for 15 days as part of the corruption investigation, the Egyptian public prosecutor said in a statement.Mubarak said he would not be returning to politics and he had left office in "the interest of the country". He said he would write to Egyptian officials to say he would cooperate with their investigation, and added the inquest would find his assets were "far from any allegations of corruption," following which he would "legally pursue those who engaged in lies and distortions against me."In an audio message which aired today on {w|Al-Arabiya}, Mubarak said he would not "stay silent regarding the incitement campaign against me." He said: "I have been in great pain because of the unjust campaigns and untrue allegations targeting myself and my family. They aim to tarnish my reputation and discredit my integrity, my stance, my political and military history during which I worked hard for Egypt and its people in peace and war." On Friday, dozens were injured and at least one person killed as the Egyptian army moved into {w|Tahrir Square} in Cairo to clear protesters calling for Mubarak to stand trial for corruption. The army has denied using {w|live ammunition}, but several people suffered gunshot wounds.Three people within Mubarak's administration have been charged with corruption by Egyptian authorities in the wake of Mubarak stepping down from his position as president two months ago after widespread protests in Egypt. Officials have denied reports he is unwell, and he is thought to be residing at his home in {w|Sharm el-Sheikh}, on the coast of the {w|Red Sea}. He has been barred from leaving the country.== Sources == 
[[Iceland voters reject deal to repay billions to UK, Dutch]]Results from Iceland's  referendum on Saturday  show that Icelanders overwhelmingly  voted "no" on a government-approved plan to repay Britain and the Netherlands billions of euros lost in Iceland's 2008 bank crash.In Sunday's final results almost 60 percent  rejected the deal, with the voting turnout high,  the government reported. This is the second repayment plan rejected by the voters; {w|Icelandic loan guarantees referendum, 2010|the first one was rejected by 93 percent  last year}.British and Dutch investors lost 3.9 billion euros in {w|Icesave}, an Icelandic internet bank that failed in {w|2008¨C2011 Icelandic financial crisis|Iceland's economic collapse of 2008}.  The two governments reimbursed their citizens and are now seeking repayment from Iceland. Iceland compensated its own citizens for losses but not overseas depositors.The latest repayment plan took two years to work out between Britain, the Netherlands and Iceland and was passed by a 70 percent majority of the Icelandic parliament. It provided for a lower interest rate and a longer repayment period, conditions much more beneficial to Iceland than the previous plan. The cost would average about  12,000 euros before interest per Icelander. Those against the referendum felt that amount was a heavy burden on Iceland and  the taxpayer was not legally responsible for  a private bank's losses.In a press conference, Iceland's  {w|Steingrimur Sigfusson|Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson} said, "I think it's very hard to interpret this in any other way than the fact that the Icelandic people are not prepared to accept payments or shoulder the burden unless there is a clear legal obligation to do so."  He said that Iceland can pay its debts and the country has the reserves to cover future payments. But Iceland's {w|Johanna Sigurdardottir|Prime Minister J¨®hanna Sigur?ard¨®ttir} said the referendum results were disappointing and have divided the country. She considers acceptance of the payment plan essential to Iceland's attempts to join the European Union. Under an EU directive, Britain and the Netherlands are owed compensation by Iceland. The International Monetary Fund's 2009  loan to Iceland of $2.1 billion  contained the provision that Iceland repay the British and Dutch governments. Britain and the Netherlands are in a position to  block Iceland's  application for European Union membership. The Netherlands and Britain said the opportunity to  negotiate has passed and the dispute will end up before the {w|European Free Trade Association}, the court  for the {w|European Economic Area}.British  {w|Danny Alexander|Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander} said that the British government had fulfilled its obligation to its citizens to compensate them for their losses. "We have an obligation now to get that money back, and we will continue to pursue that until we do. ... We have a difficult financial position as a country and this money would help."Dutch {w|Jan Kees de Jager|Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager} said, "Iceland remains obliged to repay. The issue is now for the courts to decide."The increasingly bitter dispute must be resolved for Iceland to have access to financial markets essential to fund its recovery, experts say, and resolution is essential for  Iceland's attempts to become an EU member.== Sources == 
[[British seaman appears in court, charged with murder after shooting on nuclear submarine]]An able seaman in the {w|Royal Navy} has appeared at a {w|magistrates court} in {w|Southampton}, England this morning, charged with murder and attempted murder.  Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donovan is accused of shooting a crewmate dead in a Royal Navy nuclear submarine last week. One other crewman, Lt. Commander Christopher Hodge, was seriously injured in the attack and remains in stable condition at a local hospital.Last night, the chief prosecutor for the {w|Crown Prosecution Service} in {w|Wessex} confirmed that 22-year old Donovan, who served aboard {w|HMS Astute|HMS Astute}, had been charged with killing 36-year-old Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux and attempting to murder three others; Petty Officer Christopher Brown, Chief Petty Officer David McCoy and Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge. "Having reviewed the evidence, I am satisfied that there is sufficient to charge him, and that it is in the public interest to do so," he said.Over the weekend serious questions over the Royal Navy's recruitment policy were raised as it emerged he had changed his name to Reggie Moondogg and tried to start a singing career as a {w|rap} artist. Relatives of the alleged gunman criticised the Royal Navy for not allowing Donovan to leave the Astute after a confrontation with a number of other crewmen. One, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officers knew of Donovan's deteriorating relationships with several other crew, but failed to take action. The shootings occurred on Friday when the submarine was docked in Southampton and a party of local dignitaries visited the vessel. It is alleged Donovan walked into the control room of the ship with an {w|SA80} assault rifle and fired multiple shots, killing Molyneux and injuring another serviceman. Molyneux's widow, Gillian, has this weekend described Molyneux, a father of four, as "utterly devoted to his family".== Sources == 
[[Baguio]][14:00]   [14:00]  Meetings yay! [14:01]  So what do we do first? apologies for absence? Move to approve the minutes of the last meeting? [14:01] == BarkingFish [~thor@wikipedia/BarkingFish] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:01]  Well, first of all let's see what's on the agenda that we can tackle [14:02] == Nascar [4a2294de@gateway/web/freenode/ip.74.34.148.222] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:02]  How about peer-review? Is it too strict? [14:02]  Salut / Good Evening / Guten abend / Buenos noches / Buonasera [14:02]  Saluton BarkingFish. [14:03]  Have I missed anything? [14:03]  No, not really too strict.  When it gets too *lax*, so we start making a lot of mistakes, that creates tension on the project. [14:03]  Yes. That was an issue I'd like to highlight: What do we do about peer review? Do you agree with the proposal to allow selfpublishing and peer review live side by side? Why or why not? [14:03]  by the way, who's chairing? [14:03]  Nope, just kicked off Nascar [14:03]  No chairman, KillingVector - this is just an open meeting [14:03]  because I have a sense that there's not a lot of point drafting an agenda and then having a free-for-all discussion. [14:03]  Why you kick me? [14:04]  There's no strict flow or anything, we'll just take the discussion wherever people want to take it. The agenda is just a suggested starting point from which we can launch new ideas. [14:04]  I think he meant we just started, Nascar. [14:04]  No, Nascar - kicked off is another way of saying "it's started" [14:04]  Ah OK. Well, in that case. [14:04]  Sorry, I had the other meaning of kicked on here. :/ [14:04]  OK, have we started logging? [14:04]   [14:05]  * Nascar feels we need to change the display of our site. [14:05]  We started already. [14:05]  Ah, right, sorry. I forgot. Anyways, back on topic [14:05]  At 21:00. [14:05]  The proposal put forward by some editors to loosen peer review to the extent that some articles would be published without review is fundamentally flawed, in that it addresses the wrong problem while putting the integrity of the project at risk. [14:06]  The problem we face immediately is an insufficiency of new editors becoming engaged with the project and developing to the point where they write good, publishable articles. [14:06]  I think we do need to remove it, but we don't need to publish nonsense. [14:06]  BarkingFish: Buenas noches ;) [14:06] == Tyrol5 [60ec95f5@gateway/web/freenode/ip.96.236.149.245] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:06] == BarkingFish [~thor@wikipedia/BarkingFish] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer] [14:06]  Hi Tyrol5 [14:06] == BarkingFish [~thor@wikipedia/BarkingFish] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:06]  Hey Diego! [14:07]  sorry about that, my network died [14:07]  The question that should be asked, then, is "how do we engage new editors?" The proposal to drop peer review makes a vague, hand-wavy attempt to answer this by saying that if what people submit is automatically published -- regardless of quality -- then first-time editors will be encouraged to write a second article. [14:07]  St-Lemur, I agree to some extent. At the same time though, I don't feel the status quo is working for us either. As I've said before, we're perpetually stuck "behind the curve" because articles wait hours or days before they're published [14:07]  So what is this all about, last time I didn't pay attention [14:07]  We don't want to publish copyvios, or factual errors, or POV.  That's most of peer review right there. [14:07]  Then they're of no use to anyone, because the MSM has long moved on to fresher topics [14:07]  But even if this is so, what will, then, encourage editors to write a *good* second article? [14:08]  The essential confusion is that the proposers are mixing up total article count with total number of articles worth reading. [14:08]  Our newest editor is Mattisse, we haven't had one to write multiple articles since then. [14:09]  Wikinews can't do synthesis articles that are as up to date as their sources; and the cure for *very* late is more contributors, which gets us back to recruiting and retention. [14:09]  Nascar: well... Matisse isn't the "newest" editor, but the most notorious recently [14:09]  Just as a comparison, does anyone know whether we published a lot of POV/poorly-written material in the days when selfpublish was the norm? [14:09]  pizero, yeah, by definition synthesis articles will be behind the curve. [14:09]  How do we stand now in terms of reliability and NPOV compared to then? Is it markedly better? [14:10]  I meant the last editor who is newer than most of us who has created more than one article. [14:10]  I wouldn't know unfortunately, tempodivalse - since I wasn't around on WN when you used to permit self publish [14:10]  Maybe come up with a right that if you get past a certain point people can trust you not to right copyvio etc? [14:10]  But in my eyes, with our presence on GNews and our wish to keep ourselves reliable, the option to permit self publication is not one I would support in any form. [14:10]  That's an idea we floated around a bit, Nascar [14:10]  Nascar, but that trips over the problem of getting *new* people [14:11]  My sense trawling the archives is that our quality is distinctly higher. [14:11]  The community can allow certain editors to self-publish [14:11]  That means that the number of articles in the queue becomes lower [14:11]  in this way the "unpublished articles" problem is actually two problems -- one, new peoples' articles not being published because they're crap and the experienced people aren't fixing them; and two, experienced peoples' articles languishing in the queue. [14:11]  and allows reviewers to focus on newbies' articles [14:11]  If peer review is falling behind so far that we're losing stories because of staleness, we need to look at making sure reviewers clear the queue in a timely fashion, maybe making some of them "duty" staff [14:11] == brianmc-phone [~brianmc@wikinews/brianmc] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:11]  Nobody is beyond making mistakes. [14:12]  Ah I don't even have review right now, so I most definately can't self publish my own articles. [14:12]  pizero, true. I'm just trying to find a balance here. [14:12]  hi brianmc-phone [14:12]  So, let's phrase this another way: Is the status quo working? Do we need to change anything at all? [14:12] == Nascar has changed nick to Nascar1996 [14:12]  My recollection from 2 - 2 1/2 years ago is that on IRC, experienced reviews would "swap" tasks -- someone would say "I'll review your article if you review mine", and I thought this worked quite well. [14:12]  The status quo isn't working.  The question is, how do we change it without screwing the system? [14:13]  St-Lemur: That doesn't work well. [14:13]  I fell into that "trap" and wound up resigning. [14:13]  There are ways it fell down. I generally don't review sports articles much, simply because I don't give a fuck about sports. [14:14]  pizero knows the full story behind that. [14:14]  We need to work on helping newbies, and on keeping things from blowing up between newbies and established Wikinewsies, and between established Wikinewsies. [14:14]  It does if the community is static, or very slowly growing [14:14]  To get more editors we need to get more people to know this wiki exists. Most people thinks Wikipedia is the only one. [14:14]  *think [14:15]  so the whole issue really is about how effectively we recruit [14:15]  pizero: The problem with that is, that my feeling certainly is that those of us who are "established" wikinewsies shouldn't be dumbing down so the newcomers can keep up. [14:15]  Could we maybe look at news-on-Wikipedia articles and wikistalk promising editors? Say, "Hi, I noticed you're editing an article about x, did you know that there's en.wikinews.org for..." [14:15]  St-Lemur, yes. Not only that, though, but how to retain contributors. Wikinews has a far higher burnout rate than any other WMF wiki I've seen. [14:15]  Maybe a little bit when they first join, but they need to get up to speed, and quick [14:15]  * Nascar1996 does believe Wikinewsies shouldn't be as harsh as they are. [14:16]  st-lemur, I don't think wikipedians would enjoy that sort of linkspamming [14:16]  I think that if you actually approached editors on WP that are explicitly interested in journalism about WN, we might get some new faces around here [14:16]  They've frowned upon that in the past [14:16]  tempodivalse, who has? [14:17]  Wikipedians. They don't really appreciate canvassing to other projects [14:17] == dendodge [~dendodge@wikinews/Dendodge] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:17]  the users themselves or jealous admins? [14:17]  Most don't. [14:17]  Well, I don't know about that. I'm not in a position to comment on en.wp politics. [14:17]  I tried to get Wikinews mentioned in various ongoing event-type templates... Went down like a lead balloon. [14:18]  BRS is the best person to ask about that, since he's got admin on both projects, tempodivalse [14:18]  when he's about that is. [14:18]  I wouldn't be upset by it. Although, I mainly found WN on a whim [14:18]  I mean, if it's just Sceptre being a pain in the ass... [14:18]  I think we need to stop worrying about WP and comparing ourselves to them all the time [14:18]  Mace beats Sceptre. :p [14:19]  Wikipedia is the majorly active Wiki other than Commons. [14:19]  Nod. And perhaps Wiktionary. [14:19]  The newbie experience on Wikinews is *rough*; I got through it by going slowly, just copyediting here and there for many months.  Until we can help newbies up to speed better, putting more of them through the wringer is of limited use. [14:19]  I think we need to nom someone to control this discussion. It's a free for all atm. [14:19]  @Tempo That's hard to do, considering that most of us spend time there [14:20]  Nascar1996: yeah, but that doesn't mean we can't make Wikinews popular ;) [14:20]  Most newbies' first articles seem to be ignored. My first article was about to go stale when it finaly was publsihed. [14:20]  The only reason I stuck with Wikinews in the first place was because the community was so welcoming.  It seems something has changed since then... [14:21]  same here, dendodge [14:21]  The more popular Wikinews is, the more people will be motivated to hang on long enough to get the hang of it.  That's not all that's needed, but it's a help. [14:21]  The reason I have after all of this is that I just find Wikinews very inviting. [14:21]  dendodge: yeah [14:21]  although my first articles were ... deleted [14:21]  i decided to hang around [14:21]  Nascar1996: They're not ignored, but as I said in the last meeting, sometimes even a newcomers best efforts are at the titanic end of the market. [14:22]  I stuck with Wikinews because Tempo welcomed me warmly. It's seems like a small, happy community then. Less so now. [14:22]  Mostly unsalvageable [14:22]  True. [14:22]  Wikinews is an amazing concept, but the execution is teh sux. [14:22]  Newbie articles are more work for reviewers, hence a reviewer with limited time will naturally choose a different article; that's perfectly reasonable from the *reviewer's* perspective. [14:22]  Luckily, my first article last July went well, so I stuck around. I didn't find the place to be particularly inviting [14:22] == Mattise [~chatzilla@dt021nbe.tampabay.res.rr.com] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:22]  Here's a proposal for you then. [14:23]  agreed pizero [14:23]  How about we set up a staff of Wikinews users as a Newcomer Assistance Team [14:23]  BF, we used to have that - Wikinews Welcomittee [14:23]  It didnt' really work. [14:23]  Made useless by the bot. [14:23]  Who on WN doesn't bite? We all bite. I bite. [14:23]  We were having trouble being inviting in July; we were kind of demoralized at the time. [14:23]  @Tyrol5 main problem is how awful a lot of first articles are: basically faster to rewrite than salvage [14:23]  I think we should be devoting more time to newbies' articles. Those first two or three stories are *so* important in establishing a person's perspective of the project. [14:23]  I don't just bite, i chew and spit the bones out St-Lemur [14:23]  * Nascar1996 stays away from most newcomers. [14:24]  I don't bite, much. [14:24]  I try to be helpful. [14:24]  Evening Mattise :) [14:24]  What we need is one of three things: a) Drastically change the review process; ?) Shift our focus from lots of small bit stories to longer collaborative OR, which is more suited to the wiki model; or ?) Somehow get many, many, more contributors. [14:24]  Evening to you [14:24]  News is intense; it's hard not to bite, and even harder not to appear to bite. [14:24]  Mikemoral: The welcommittee may have been made useless by the bot, but having a set of users who will help newcomers can't be too bad a thing. [14:24]  Preferably all three. [14:25]  dendodge: I think we pretty much already know that, that's been said over and over again. [14:25]  The question is, how. [14:25]  Do we, for example, have a {helpme} template? [14:25]  I don't know. [14:25]  I think that if some editors were readily available to assist with first articles, we might have more people that stick around. I've seen users not come back b/c their first article was deleted [14:25]  BF, yes! That's a good idea. [14:25]  I'm just putting it out there. [14:25]  BarkingFish: True. Sort of like WP's newbie helpers. [14:25]  WP use one, to alert admins that the user requires assistance [14:25]  For us, as a community at the moment, the first two are easy. [14:25]  I don't have any idea about most of the templates we have, and I've been here for a while [14:25]  that would at least be a start [14:26]  agreed [14:26]  Similar to WPs? [14:26]  yes [14:26]  There isn't a drastic problem with the review process.  As I remarked way early, copyvio and accuracy and NPOV are most of review. [14:26]  I think we should get rid of the bot [14:26]  The thing is, nothing will work unless the new contributors feel welcome. Nobody wants to stick around on a project where they're not appreciated. I think we could improve in that regard [14:26]  pizero: The biggest problem with review is that sometimes, the length of articles which a person takes on to review is in itself, a discouragement. [14:26]  The review reforms are pretty much ready to be implemented, but we're not doing it.  And we can easily get a few of the long-term contributors to work together on some ground-breaking OR. [14:26]  This is true, the bot seems a bit impersonal [14:26]  Once we do that, our contributor base will grow exponentially. [14:27]  We ummed and ah'd about brianmc-phone's interview, primarily because of the length.  It was a damn good interview, no question, but it's an example of one thing that puts a reviewer off. [14:27]  Editors ready to help newcomers won't work without better techniques for helping newcomers.  I put huge effort into helping Mattisse, and I'm sure Mattisse will agree that just didn't work out well. [14:27]  Tyrol, yes, but the idea was to educate newbies about our cornerstone policies before they have a chance to do something clearly out of scope [14:27]  If you are talking about the welcome template, I found it very helpful and still use it to start an article. [14:27]  Bad part is that we can't figure a way how to change the review process. [14:27] == Jersey [43b7aa90@wikimedia/S3CR3T] has joined #wikinews-workshop [14:27]  a bot is much more efficient than a team of users could be. I'm uncertain that it's impersonal [14:28]  Don't ditch the bot. Make the Welcommittee different; responsible for pushing stuff back to dev with some pointers and c/e. [14:28]  The welcome bot is a good start [14:28]  Yes, Welcomittee can play a key role here. But make sure it is *welcoming*. [14:28]  but a personal service from someone who will stay and help you through what you're trying to do has got to be 100x better [14:28]  The culture we need to have in reviewing is one of actively fixing things, instead of just slapping a template on it and the words "3/20 SEE ME" in red pen on the top. [14:28]  I liked getting my welcome [14:29]  Tempo: Although I might suggest that Wikinewsies offer a welcome as well, even after the bot [14:29]  St-Lemur: bingo. I'm frustrated at how people fail articles just because they are missing a category or something, when everything else is fine [14:29]  Mattise: Would you have felt differently with a personal welcome rather than a bot issued one? Would it have made a difference? [14:29] == Mattise has changed nick to Mattisse [14:29]  Hey, the name change worked this time! [14:30]  :) [14:30]  I appreciated a personal welcome. Imo, the bot does indeed seem impersonal. [14:30]  Yes, how can we make actively fixing things more a part of the process, given that a reviewer has to remain independent if they're going to review? [14:30]  then reviewer 1 does the re-write and reviewer 2 reviews and publishes [14:30]  that's collaborative. [14:30]  Instant de-reviewer for publish without a copyedit? :P [14:31]  seems like tempodivalse welcomed me :D [14:31]  The fact that I was welcomed by Tempo instead of the bot made a difference in staying [14:31]  pizero: I think moderate alterations to articles shouldn't make a reviewer "uninvolved" [14:31]  What good is a personal welcome? Would the welcomer continue helping that newbie? [14:31]  Can we identify the key 1st submission failings? I put 'slapping review on too early' at the top of my list; it's asking to be bitten. [14:31]  St-Lemur: But that means we need more editors to publish. that'll drive up review times, not lower them [14:31]  Possibly, we could introduce some sort of mentoring/adoption program [14:31]  * dendodge was welcomed by brianmc-phone :) [14:31]  Ok Mattisse - I see where you're coming from with that. [14:31]  And Tyrol5 - you just beat me to it [14:31]  It hasn't in the past, since an article that's all written and ready to go can just be reviewed and go out the door [14:32]  I was just about to suggest something again from WP, the "Adopt a newcomer" program [14:32]  Sorry :) [14:32]  * Nascar1996 wasnt welcomed by any. : [14:32]  pizero, also a good point [14:33]  :) [14:33]  I, at one time, was the Wikinews 'WalMart greeter'. [14:33]  you got me too, brianmc-phone :) [14:33]  My welcome when I came back to WN was from you [14:33]  I still haven't been given the new welcome template... : [14:58]  We have a help me template! http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Template:Helpme [14:58]  It's a very closed society here. You have to belong to a particular culture or you don't understand what's going on. [14:58]  um, why do you say that matisse? [14:59]  *mattisse [14:59]  No matter how "welcoming" a template is, a newbie will go by what he sees on wiki, which is not much. [14:59]  I agree [14:59]  For help, I looked at the recent changes and asked the first editor I seen for help. [14:59]  Nascar1996: Ok then, that works. If it categorises users correctly, I'll test it with helpmebot and see how we go on. [15:00]  I perceive it. But also I was tolk to watch a 1990s UK sit com if I wanted to understand what editors were saying [15:00]  BarkingFish: Looks like http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Wikinewsies_looking_for_help is the category. [15:00]  that would need changing [15:00]  What should it be moved to. [15:00]  The bot responds to articles added to Category:Help [15:01]  but we can't do that [15:01]  i don't think the issue is the culture, it's the people.  there is very much a dividing line between old people like BRS, Brian Mc, TUFKAAP, etc and reletive newbies, and that line is *extremely* hard to cross [15:01]  because that category already exists [15:01]  any article needing review is spammed into the channel... [15:01]  how about any page with {helpme} is similarly spammed? [15:01]  Agree with C628 [15:02]  @C628 I think that's a common problem a young project would fix [15:02]  BarkingFish: Can I change the WN template to look similar to the WP template. The WP template looks better anyway. [15:02]  * dendodge managed to cross the line, sort of. [15:02]  * dendodge is a middly. [15:02]  *have, not fix [15:02]  Mattisse: I think he just meant that a number of editors use jokes from there.  I'd never heard of that sitcom. [15:02]  I've never heard of it. [15:02]  i think Mattisse's example of being advised to watch a TV show in order to find out wtf is going is a perfect example [15:02]  Nascar1996: Hm [15:02]  Will be away from computer for some time [15:03]  Let me look at that and see. [15:03]  I think he was just saying we exhibit a similar warped sense of humour to the writers of that sitcom. [15:03] == diegogrez_ [~diegogrez@186.20.52.44] has quit [Ping timeout: 258 seconds] [15:03]  But all he was doing was recommending a TV show.  I don't think he was saying you had to watch it. [15:03]  Well. that implies a narrow cultural perspective. [15:04]  Mattisse: Hey, have you ever seen Star Trek?  I think it's a great show.  You might like it. [15:04]  Do we have a IRC channel to help newcomers? Similar to #wikipedia-en-help ? [15:04]  but that's not helpful.

[15:08]  I think we're on for the helpme template, stwalkerster, who runs helpmebot, is looking at making some changes to the bot so we can have our own instance for alerting us when a user needs help. [15:16]  The last piece of real collaboration I remember is the Fort Hood shootings article. [15:16]  This gets back to the need for a reviewer to remain sufficiently uninvolved if they want to review at article - and the fewer active reviewers there are, the more motivated a reviewer is to try to remain sufficiently uninvolved, 'cause nobody else is likely to review if xe doesn't. [15:17]  pizero: It's pretty much a catch 22 [15:18]  The problem is, the more people contribute to an article, the higher the chance that there isn't going to be an uninvolved reviewer [15:18]  BarkingFish: Too long to edit on phone. Change point 5 on 1st tab to "ask here, or put {helpme} on the relevant Talk/Discussion page" [15:18]  ok [15:18]  That is only if you have a very small pool of reviewers [15:19]  Mattisse: the size of the pool doesn't matter, when the reviewers are not significantly motivated enough to review an article anyway [15:19] == diegogrez_ has changed nick to diegogrez [15:19]  there are something like 160 reviewers. I have never seen more than a couple of people work on an article [15:19]  brb, just going to sort out the welcome template [15:20]  This is why we need to do something.  The super-slow review process is, when it comes down to it, the root of *all* our problems. [15:20]  The solution is less clear. [15:21]  What do editors enjoy doing here? [15:21]  Talk on IRC rather than have a transparent community? [15:22]  brianmc: The {helpme} goes on the user [15:22]  's talk page, along with their question. [15:22]  Mattisse: exactly [15:22] == dendodge [~dendodge@wikinews/Dendodge] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer] [15:22]  BarkingFish: Also add pretty much the same on the writing an article tab. Might I also suggest that the editing help in main namespace has a link to create a {helpme} section on the talk? [15:22]  If a bunch of people collaborate on IRC, whose to know who is "involved" and can't review? [15:23]  yep, ok brianmc-phone [15:23]  I'm trying to work out what to edit and where, so be patient, I don't want to screw this up :) [15:23]  Collaboration on IRC is finding sources, highlighting relevant points, less-so on the actual writing. [15:24] == dendodge [~dendodge@wikinews/Dendodge] has joined #wikinews-workshop [15:24]  brianmc-phone: Would I be editing Template:Howdy/content ? [15:24]  So that means collaboration on IRC doesn't mean you can't review? [15:24]  Sorry, Firefox just crashed. [15:25]  Errr, maybe - it is under FR, so chill if you screw it [15:25]  ok [15:25]  dendodge: The slow review process isn't the root of *all* our problems.  Some of our problems come from the fact that we haven't figured out a smooth way to help newbies scrabble up the initial learning "curve". [15:25]  Not unless you're contributing content. [15:26]  brianmc-phone: that looks right - I'm gonna save it [15:27]  Who's doing the embedded channel in the newsroom then? [15:27]  Also, newbies who aren't up to speed can contribute significantly to the review times, so the problems reinforce each other nicely. [15:27]  just gonna warn #wikimedia-tech there maybe a bit of a job queue, this edit is gonna affect about 80000 pages [15:28]  Lol [15:29]  there it goes :) [15:29]  there it goes :) [15:30]  does that look ok on the template? [15:30]  He's right, it's about 80000 pages; I counted them when I put the {high-risk} template on the {howdy} documentation. [15:31]  i only found out when I went to edit and got warned it was used on a shedload of pages [15:31]  looks good to me, BF [15:32]  What is the point of putting in on 800000 pages, when hardly any of those are actually editors who edit here? [15:32]  It's the bot [15:32]  Matisse, the hope is that someone will be motivated by the template to write [15:32]  and the bot can't distinguish between "real" users and those who had an account auto-created by the WMF wiki-farm software [15:33]  I don't think it is lack of motivation that's the problem [15:33]  anyway, the information is there, so we're gonna start to see that template in use I'd imagine [15:33] == C628 [a6f800e9@wikinews/C628] has quit [Quit: Page closed] [15:33]  and stwalkerster is going to sort out the helpmebot for us :) [15:34]  I've asked him to drop it in #wikinews for now until we open a help channel [15:34]  We need our own help chan? [15:34]  * diegogrez won't be around for the next hour - needs to ride his bicycle a bit :P [15:34]  tempodivalse: perhaps #wikinews-help [15:34]  tempodivalse: Not necessarily [15:34]  BarkingFish, also mention it on the start an article tab, but to put it on the article discussion page. [15:35]  it's just that the bot normally runs in a help channel [15:35]  I imagine people could just come to #wikinews-en [15:35]  brianmc-phone: I don't think the template is meant to work anywhere other than on a user talk page [15:35]  I'll check it over [15:36]  the helpme was originally designed to use on talk pages for peeps asking questions, i think it would look funny for articles to start asking for help too :) [15:38]  sorry, I had to AFK for a bit suddenly. What's been decided? [15:38]  We're going to set up an irc help channel w/ bot [15:38]  Not much, it appears. We were discussing the welcome template. [15:39]  for use w/ {helpme} [15:39]  ah OK. I still think embedding the IRC channel in the newsroom would be the rockingest thing we could do [15:39]  meanwhile back in real life, "Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in negotiations with the African Union, has agreed in principal to a deal that would end the conflict in the nation he's ruled for 42 years, South African President Jacob Zuma told reporters Sunday." [15:40]  That's old news [15:40]  I'll pop it on the start an article tab as well, brianmc-phone - it would work, just direct people to ask question about the article or the edit on their own pages [15:40]  I think the irc in the newsroom idea was tossed around a little bit ago [15:40]  Any final decision? [15:40]  I'd love to have irc embedded in the newsroom [15:40]  do it [15:40]  anything for "transparency" [15:40]  i agree [15:41]  * brianmc-phone nearly finished creating #wikinews-en-newsroom [15:42]  yay [15:42]  How is it to be embedded? [15:42]  I still reserve the right to discuss things out of earshot though. There are some things I won't make public in any form. [15:42]  I'd prefer we used an existing chan for this purpose [15:42]  #wikinews-en can fit the bill, it's off teh beaten track [15:42]  transparency is one thing, stupidity is another and I'll be damned if I'm gonna mix the two in one place [15:42]  What about the help chan? [15:42]  do we need it seperate? [15:43]  It seems more logical to me to have a newsroom channel mirrored on-wiki [15:43]  i don't think so [15:43] == Amgine [~Amgine@wikinews/Amgine] has joined #wikinews-workshop [15:43]  Hi Amgine! [15:43]  since most of the users congregate in #wikinews, seems more sense to have it there tempodivalse [15:44]  A help channel would belong on WC/Assistance [15:44]   Sorry, I was busy with house restruction. [15:44]  #wikinews is multilingual. If other chans want to have helplines that would conflict [15:44]  Alerts can be posted in #wikinews, don't start logging and/or publicly posting it [15:45]  you don't.  All the bot does is tell you who needs the help, and allows you a direct link to their page to answer the question. [15:46]  it presents a wikilink, and I assume Wikilink2 will turn it straight into a link for us [15:47]  Hmm... [15:47]  It also nags you if a user's been waiting more than an hour for help :) [15:47]  Helpmebot creates link automagically when someone types !link. [15:48]  yes, but with wikilink2 in the channel, that won't be needed unless the link goes from your scrollback, in which case typing that will give you the link of the last person who asked for help [15:48]  Or the last link someone said in 
[[]]. [15:50]  yeah [15:51]  But there is a way of calling up users who still need help if I remember [15:51]  which would bypass the !link thing [15:52]  !helpme [15:52]  that's the one [15:52]  I knew it was there somewhere [15:52]  brb [15:53]  The bot also nags about protected edit requests. Would we want that? [15:54]  I think stwalkerster is only setting ours up for helpme requests [15:54]  he's altering the database for us [15:56]  There's never that many per's anyway [15:56]  I've hardly seen any tbh [15:59]  The other thing I'd like to look at is a Speed dial option for new users.  Sort of a reference list of places they can immediately click on to do different things [16:05]  Can people join #wikinews-en-newsroom ? Hope not too locked down, and need to template people... [16:11]  right, I've set nascar on the task of giving the helpme template a facelift [16:12]  basically just to add a little more info, make it a bit brighter and generally hose down the outside :) [16:12]  *wonders what are we going to do...* [16:12]  we don't need a seperate helpme for admin questions do we? Maybe a link from helpme to the AAA should suffice [16:13]  yeah [16:22]  Seeing that discussion has died down, could we call this meeting to an end? [16:22]  Make it so. [16:23]  Oh, wait. [16:23]   
[[France first to enforce burqa ban]]France yesterday became the first country in Europe to ban women from concealing their faces in public. Anyone wearing a face-concealing veil such as the Muslim {w|niq¨¡b} or {w|burqa} in the country can, as of yesterday, be fined {w|Euro|?}150 and forced to attend {w|citizenship} classes.People found to have forced others to wear a veil can be sentenced to prison for up to two years. While France contains the largest Muslim population in Europe, only an estimated 2,000 women in the country wear the niq¨¡b or burqa.The French government said the face-concealing veil does not match the French concept of equality and does not meet the standards of a shared, {w|democratic} society. Women found wearing a veil in public can now be taken to a police station and asked to remove the veil for identification, police have said.On Saturday police detained 59 people who protested the veil ban in a forbidden demonstration in the capital, Paris, 19 of the protesters were veiled women. Other European countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, have also proposed similar bans, although they are yet to enforce them. Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has called for terrorist attacks on France after claiming the country has gone to war against Islam.== Sources == 
[[Crisis at stricken Japan nuclear plant escalates to level of Chernobyl; six killed in aftershock]]The crisis at a {w|Fukushima I nuclear power plant|stricken nuclear plant} on the northeast coast of Japan is now as severe as the {w|Chernobyl disaster|disaster at Chernobyl} in 1986, officials have said. Radiation is continuing to leak from the plant, which was damaged during the devastating magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami last month, which left thousands dead. Japanese authorities have warned the crisis is now a "major accident" with "wider consequences" than previously thought.A spokesperson for {w|Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA}, the Japanese government nuclear authority, said officials had upgraded the crisis to a level seven on the {w|International Nuclear Event Scale}¡ªthe same applied to the Chernobyl disaster¡ªbecause of a number of factors, including the detection of radiation in crops. "We have upgraded the severity level to seven as the impact of radiation leaks has been widespread from the air, vegetables, tap water and the ocean," he said.The news comes as a new blow after another powerful aftershock yesterday which left at least six people dead after they were killed in a {w|mudslide} in the city of {w|Iwaki, Fukushima|Iwaki}. The landslide, which destroyed numerous homes, was triggered by a {w|Richter magnitude scale|magnitude} 6.6 aftershock which came exactly a month after the 9.0 magnitude earthquake. Fire officials in the city said three people had already been rescued and taken to hospital, and emergency workers were working to free an unknown number of others.Workers at the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant returned after they were briefly evacuated following the earthquake, and officials issued tsunami warnings for the northeast coast which were later cancelled. Workers have been fighting a desperate battle to prevent the reactors from overheating and entering {w|nuclear meltdown|meltdown}. Raging fires burned into the night after the earthquake, and TEPCO reported widespread power outages; hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses had power cut off.Reports of the change in severity at the damaged nuclear plant followed the announcement that the {w|nuclear exclusion zone|exclusion zone} around the site was to be expanded. A spokesperson for the government confirmed the radius of the zone would be expanded to include another five communities over the next several weeks. He stressed there was "no need to evacuate immediately" but said concerns had been raised over health risks from the leaking radiation.The new development at the plant and the aftershock are new blows to a country wounded after the massive earthquake in March, which caused a tsunami that washed away whole towns and villages along the country's northeast coast. Thousands of bodies have been recovered, and many more are still unaccounted for, many left under mounds of rubble or washed out to sea. More than 150,000 people remain displaced, living in emergency shelters.Before the aftershock struck yesterday, survivors of the first earthquake marked the time it hit a month ago with a {w|moment of silence} across the country. Writing to seven international newspapers, {w|Naoto Kan}, the {w|Prime minister of Japan|Japanese prime minister},  expressed his gratitude to people globally for their support. "Through our own efforts and with the help of the global community, Japan will recover and come back even stronger. We will then repay you for your generous aid," he wrote. "With this in our hearts, we now stand together dedicated to rebuilding the nation."== Sources == 
[[Tsunami warnings issued and nuclear workers evacuated after massive aftershock rocks Japan]]The *demands* are secular, but the sides are sect based. Shiite uprising vs Sunni overlords. The Shiite protestors may be demanding nothing more than fair treatment, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a sect vs sect conflict.If you disagree, then show me equal numbers of Sunni protestors out on the streets.

[[Gbagbo detained by opposition forces and taken to meet Ouattara in Ivory Coast hotel]]Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent president of Ivory Coast, is being taken to a hotel in the capital Abidjan to meet with internationally recognised leader Alassane Ouattara after the beseiged ruler was detained by forces loyal to the opposition.The permanent representative of Ivory Coast to the United Nations in New York, {w|Youssoufou Bamba}, said Gbagbo, who he described as "alive and well", had been captured by opposition forces in a raid on his presidential palace in Abidjan and will stand trial. The prime minister in Ouattara's prospective government has called on Gbagbo loyalists to join the opposition this afternoon, reports indicate.Bamba confirmed forces loyal to Ouattara had captured Gbagbo, rather than French or U.N. forces as had initially been reported. "The nightmare is over for the people of Ivory Coast, there is much celebration," Bamba said. "He is now being held in a safe place for the next steps to put him on trial." New video footage of Gbagbo has emerged, purportedly showing him detained in a hotel in Abidjan where Ouattara is staying. Fighting {w|2010¨C2011 Ivorian crisis|has been continuing} in the African state since a disputed election in November last year. Supporters of Ouattara claim he won the poll and is the rightful president, but Gbagbo has refused to stand down.
[[Typhoon]]You are only partially right. Some thousands of years ago, certain races domesticated animals such as goats and cows for their meat. However, until these were slaughtered, the females of these species gave off milk, which those people realized could be given to their children instead of thrown away. Back then, only children could digest milk, but the naturally some children could digest it until a later age, and some stopped being able at an earlier age. The ones who could digest milk for longer got the benefit of the extra food, and thus had higher chances of spreading their milk digestion gene.Most of the descendants of these races can digest milk until old age today, because milk gave them a higher chance of spreading their genes. If milk is unhealthy, they would have a LOWER chance of spreading the gene, and only children would be able to digest it today.

[[Bob Dylan plays first concert in Vietnam]]The concert  came days after he played two shows  in China, where he performed in Beijing and Shanghai as part of his  Asia-Pacific tour. On Sunday, he played in {w|Ho Chi Minh City}, on a date  50 years after  his first major  performance. Dylan played outdoors on a warm evening on the grassy grounds of {w|RMIT University}. The  audience was a mixture of young and old; both foreigners and Vietnamese were present. He played in a Vietnam now at peace where half the population is under 30, too young to have memories of the war.Dressed in a purple shirt, black jacket and wearing a white hat, he was welcomed with loud applause by an enthusiastic audience. His 17-song set list  included a selection of his  1960s and 1970s hits such as "{w|All Along the Watchtower}", "{w|A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall}",  "{w|It Ain't Me Babe}", "{w|Tangled Up in Blue}", and "{w|Highway 61 Revisited|Highway 61 Revisited}" along with more recent songs.Tran Long An, vice president of the Vietnam Composers' Association noted that the significance of Dylan's Ho Chi Minh City performance was recognized by his Vietnamese fans. "Bob Dylan's music opened up a path where music was used as a weapon to oppose the war in Vietnam and fight injustice and racism," he said. "That was the big thing that he has done for music." Vietnam's communist government allows few western acts to perform. Human rights groups criticized Dylan for submitting his play list for approval by the Vietnamese government authorities, although his promoter said no restrictions were imposed. == Sources ==

[[Fatal train fire may have been suicide attempt, British police say]]A fire on a train last night in {w|Bedfordshire}, England, may have been started deliberately in a suicide attempt. The  {w|British Transport Police} has told Wikinews the incident "is not being treated as an accident". One female passenger, who is believed to have started the fire in a lavatory cubicle, was killed.No-one else was injured in the accident, but it led to the closure of the critical {w|West Coast Main Line} after emergency services attended the scene. The train was approaching {w|Leighton Buzzard} when smoke was seen coming from the washroom. "A passenger reported the fire to a conductor," a spokesperson for London Midland said. "All the other passengers got off safely."Witnesses said the blaze broke out on a rush hour train travelling to London from {w|Northampton}. "The smoke was so thick it got onto your chest," one 68-year-old said. "The fire, police and ambulance service were here very quickly." The fire caused severe rail disruption as the line was closed while electric cables running along the track were turned off to protect emergency workers at the site of the incident. Passengers have criticised London Midland for how they handled the incident. "People would have been more understanding if we knew how bad the fire was [and] that the power was off," one passenger, giving his name as Wai, wrote on the the social networking site Twitter. Another, Ross Lankshear, wrote: "It's very frustrating when you are waiting 1 hour then told trains are running but the staff are in the wrong place."London Midland told Wikinews they were attempting to restore rail services on the West Coast Main Line. "We apologise to those passengers disrupted by this tragic incident," they said. "London Midland tickets were accepted by other operators and buses used as rail replacement services."

Kennedy International Airport} in New York City. The A380 had 520 people onboard, and the smaller plane had 66.The Comair jet had just arrived from {w|Boston Logan International Airport}, and was stopped on the tarmac, awaiting a gate to offload passengers. The A380 was preparing to depart for {w|Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport}, and was taxiing along a taxiway when its wingtip struck the tail of the other plane. The impact spun the CRJ around 90 degrees and resulted in some damage to both planes.A passenger on board the A380 said that "It really felt just like a speedbump or like hitting a pothole¡ªa jolt¡ªbut it didn't feel right [it felt] like that shouldn't be happening."LiveATC.net captured the recording of the flight deck and ground control communications before and after the incident. In the recording, one can hear controllers giving taxi instructions to the Air France plane, then later a controller calling for emergency personnel to the intersection of taxiways Alpha and Mike.The {w|National Transportation Safety Board} plans to investigate the incident, and will study the flight recorders, air traffic control recordings, and data from radar on the ground.== Sources == 
[[French police arrest two women wearing veils after burqa ban goes into effect]]One day after France began enforcing a ban on the public wearing Islamic veils that cover the face, either a {w|niq¨¡b} or a {w|burqa}, French police briefly detained two veiled women. The police later claimed that the women were arrested for taking part in an unauthorized protest, not because they were wearing veils.The new {w|French ban on face covering|law} is hotly debated. The women were arrested while outside the famed {w|Notre Dame Cathedral} in Paris, and may now face fines of up to {w|US dollar|$}217, community service and/or a citizenship course under the law.While the ban covers the burqa and the niq¨¡b, it does not include the {w|hijab} or the {w|chador}. The hijab is a veil that leaves the face visible while covering the hair and neck, and the chador covers only the body.The law has stirred much debate, both in France and around the globe. Those who oppose the new law say it limits {w|freedom of speech} and {w|freedom of religion}, while supporters claim that women are degraded by wearing veils and the law is intended to empower those women, as well as increase public security.The French government, in defense of the ban, said that it was necessary because wearing veils falls short of the living standards in France and and makes women be of an lower status in a country where everybody is considered equal.French Prime Minister {w|Francois Fillon} has said that the ban is consistent with the national values of France. "The French Republic lives in a bare-headed fashion," he said in a statement published by a government newspaper.The French government previously made efforts to accommodate Muslims in the country, including establishing a council dealing with the presence of Islam; however, according to Amer Sahar, a professor who studies the topic, some Muslims in the country say that they feel as though they are under assault by the government. She said that some are "resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both Muslim and French."The French government is also concerned with women and children who are forced to veil themselves. It has said that such an action is "a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil." There is a fine of 30,000 euros and a year in prison for forcing an adult to wear the niq¨¡b or burqa. The fine is doubled for forcing a minor to wear the veils.Activist {w|Rachid Nekkaz} auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fine for any woman arrested under the law. "I would like to send a clear message to President Nicolas Sarkozy that we can do what we want. We have rules. We have a constitution and everyone has to respect it," he said.According to the {w|French Constitutional Council}, the law "conforms to the Constitution" because it does not limit the freedom of religion or excessively punish people for exercising that right in a place of worship. == Sources == 
[[Minsk]]I personally have no fears of nuclear power plants in and of themselves. What disturbs me is electric companies in a hurry to get the plant on line and making money or wanting to increase their profits and decrease the time it takes for a plant to pay for itself by cutting corners. In the early days of nuclear power plants, I believe it was Admiral Nimitz who remarked that there were people running the reactors that he wouldn't have swabbing the decks on his nuclear-powered aircraft carrier; in effect saying that companies were also cutting corners in the training of their employees. I would also like to comment on the fact that protestors against nuclear power plants seem to consist of every occupation except nuclear physicists. When I hear of scientists and physicists saying that nuclear power is unsafe in and of itself, then I will shift my position.
[[Mubarak refused permission to leave Egypt for treatment after heart attack]]Mubarak, who is banned from leaving Egypt, was today taken to hospital in the coastal city of {w|Sharm el-Sheikh}, where he has been living since being {w|Resignation of Hosni Mubarak|ousted} from power following  widespread protests across the country, a security source confirmed. It is understood aides have requested he be allowed to leave the country for Germany, where he underwent surgery on his {w|gall bladder} last year. Officials close to Mubarak have repeatedly insisted recent reports that the former leader's health was deteriorating were false.The hospital is reported to have effectively shut down since Mubarak's admission today, and is only accepting emergencies, although Wikinews cannot independently verify this report. The security source said Mubarak was taken to hospital "amid a very heavy security presence in the town" this afternoon after maintaining a low profile in the city, on the coast with the {w|Red Sea}. He arrived at the hospital in his armored {w|Mercedes}, flanked by heavy police protection, according to two doctors who spoke anonymously. Hearing the news of the hospitalization a number of protesters arrived at the hospital to picket against the former president. The hospital declined to make any comment on the news, and said the Egyptian minister of health would make a statement later today.Mubarak was being questioned by Egyptian officials, who summoned him for interrogation at the weekend, when he was taken to hospital. Prosecutors allege he ordered security forces to fire on people protesting against his rule. In an audio interview broadcast on television station {w|Al-Arabiya}, he said he would robustly defend himself against what he termed an "unjust" campaign of "distortions, lies and incitement" against him. He claimed his enemies were systematically aiming to "tarnish my reputation and discredit my integrity," and said he would legally fight those who "engaged in lies and distortions against me."== Sources == 
[[NASA celebrates 30th anniversary of first shuttle launch; announces new homes for retired shuttles]]NASA celebrated the launch of the first space shuttle Tuesday at an event at the {w|Kennedy Space Center} in {w|Cape Canaveral, Florida}. On April 12, 1981, {w|Space Shuttle Columbia} lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center on {w|STS-1}, the first space shuttle mission.NASA held a ceremony commemorating the date outside the hangar, known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1, for {w|Space Shuttle Atlantis}, which is being prepped for its final mission which will be {w|STS-135}, which will be the last Space Shuttle mission.At the ceremony, {w|NASA Administrator} {w|Charles Bolden} announced the locations that would be given the three remaining Space Shuttle orbiters following the end of the {w|Space Shuttle program}. The prototype orbiter, Space Shuttle Enterprise would be relocated from the {w|Smithsonian|Smithsonian's} {w|National Air and Space Museum} {w|Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center} at {w|Washington Dulles International Airport} to the {w|Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum} in New York City.Columbia was lost tragically back on February 1, 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry killing all seven astronauts aboard. {w|Space Shuttle Challenger} was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28, 1986 killing all six aboard."We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures," said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees. "This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mind. In the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle Program. These facilities we've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors."Over twenty locations looked to obtain one of the orbiters because of potential tourism booms from them.Not all were pleased with the final choice of locations. U.S. Senator {w|John Cornyn}, Republican from {w|Texas}, issued a statement regarding the rejection of {w|Johnson Space Center} in {w|Houston, Texas} as a location. ¡°Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA¡¯s decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle Orbiters. Houston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet."Cornyn's statement added, ¡°There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters¡ªeven Administrator Bolden stated as much. Today¡¯s announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and I¡¯m deeply disappointed with the Administration¡¯s misguided decision.¡± However, the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deck.The {w|Museum of Flight} in {w|Seattle, Washington} was also proposed as another location for a shuttle, going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiter. In a statement, {w|Governor of Washington} {w|Chris Gregoire} said, ¡°The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest. As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit. While the Museum of Flight was in the top running, I¡¯m disappointed that NASA did not choose them.¡°However, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including [former Museum of Flight CEO] {w|Bonnie Dunbar} has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight home. The largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get. Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum. It will help inspire young people to the adventure of space and to the excitement of a career in science, technology, engineering and math."Other items include various shuttle simulators which will be given to the {w|Adler Planetarium} in {w|Chicago}, Illinois, the {w|Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum} of {w|McMinnville, Oregon}, and {w|Texas A&M|Texas A&M's} Aerospace Engineering Department.

There were to be more than 400 events in 71 countries celebrating Yuri's Night this year.Gagarin's flight lasted 108 minutes, just under two hours, and consisted of one full orbit around the Earth. His trip to orbit came just four years after the launch of {w|Sputnik 1} and the beginning of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.The crew on board the International Space Station also marked the fiftieth anniversary by delivering a message from space. While addressing viewers, station commander {w|Dmitry Kondratyev} referred to the portrait of Gagarin floating next to him as a representation of the achievement of "humankind at large".A movie, entitled {w|First Orbit}, was filmed in parts in space when the orbit of the ISS matched that of Gagarin's flight. The movie, produced by filmmaker Christopher Riley, was filmed by ESA astronaut {w|Paolo Nespoli} and matches the radio communications, times, and views of the flight. The film is freely available to the public and made its debut on Tuesday to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the human race becoming a space-faring species.== Sources ==

[[Ohio executes two-time murderer]]Ohio inmate Clarence Carter, 49,  was {w|Capital punishment|executed} on Tuesday for  beating  to death  a fellow prisoner in a jail house argument over what to watch on TV, the third inmate to be executed this year by  the state.He died at 10:25 a.m. by {w|lethal injection} at the {w|Southern Ohio Correctional Facility}, the second inmate in the U.S. executed using  the  surgical sedative {w|pentobarbital}  as a stand-alone execution drug. He had been scheduled to die in 2007, but  a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of lethal injection prevented his death sentence from being carried out at the time. Carter was  incarcerated at the Hamilton County Jail Annex in {w|Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati}, Ohio,  awaiting sentencing for the  aggravated murder of Michael Hadnot, when he beat fellow inmate Johnny Allen in December 1988. Allen was jailed on a theft charge. Investigators said Carter beat, kicked, and chocked Allen over a 25 minute period. Carter had punched Allen  earlier that month in a  dispute over a TV channel.  Allen died two weeks later from his injuries.Prison officials reported that Carter was calm  and seemed in  good spirits the day before,  visiting with his brother,  his lawyers and two imams.  He was reported to have eaten dates and tuna sandwiches as his last meal before being escorted to the execution chamber.In the execution chamber he apologized to the family of his victim, stating, "I'd like to say I'm sorry for what I did, especially to his mother. I ask God for forgiveness and them for forgiveness." Carter knelt and  prayed briefly just before the execution. His brother and a lawyer witnessed the execution on his behalf. No members of the victim's family were there.  Only two media representatives attended  the execution, the lowest number since Ohio resumed the death penalty in 1999; five people protested  outside the prison walls. == Sources ==

Sources say he suffered a heart attack while being interrogated by Egyptian prosecutors, and was taken to hospital in the coastal city of {w|Sharm el-Sheikh}, where he has been living since resigning. He arrived at the hospital in an armored car and flanked by heavy protection, according to two sources in the city, which lies on the coast of the {w|Red Sea}.Outside the hospital, thousands of people gathered to demand Mubarak stand trial for ordering security forces to fire on protesters during the popular uprising earlier this year, when 800 people were killed.

[[Senior U.S. aviation official resigns after crisis in control towers termed 'unacceptable']]"I am totally outraged by these incidents," LaHood said. "This is absolutely unacceptable. The American public trusts us to run a safe system," he added, vowing to do anything necessary to resolve the issue. His comments came as the FAA announced new plans to tackle fatigue in controllers, saying they were taking immediate steps to employ additional staff at 27 airports across the U.S. The FAA said it would "not tolerate" controllers falling asleep on duty. "This type of unprofessional behavior does not meet our high safety standards," a spokesperson said.Krakowski's resignation will likely be seen as an indication that the crisis in control towers across the U.S. is growing. {w|Randy Babbitt}, the administrator of the FAA, confirmed Krakowski had submitted his resignation, which had accepted. "Over the last few weeks we have seen examples of unprofessional conduct on the part of a few individuals that have rightly caused the traveling public to question our ability to ensure their safety," he said. "This conduct must stop immediately.  I am committed to maintaining the highest level of public confidence and that begins with strong leadership." Babbitt said the FAA was conducting a "top to bottom review" air traffic control procedures.A fifth controller was suspended this week after falling asleep while on duty at {w|Reno-Tahoe International Airport} in Nevada in the early hours of this morning, forcing an {w|air ambulance} carrying a patient to land without directions from the tower. The FAA said the flight crew made contact with a controller at a different facility and made a safe landing. "The controller, who was out of communication for approximately 16 minutes, has been suspended while the FAA investigates," a spokesperson said.The incident is the latest in a string of controllers falling asleep on duty. Last month two passenger jets landed safely in Washington D.C. without clearance to do so because they were unable to make contact with any controllers in the tower at the airport. It emerged the only controller in the tower had fallen asleep after working four nights in a row. In February, a controller at {w|McGhee Tyson Airport} in Tennessee allegedly deliberately went to sleep while on duty. The controllers involved in both incidents have been suspended by the FAA. Additionally, the FAA is investigating two other incidents, one of which took place when a controller fell asleep at {w|Boeing Field} in April. It is understood the same controller was already being investigated after falling asleep twice in one night in January. Two controllers were also suspended late last month when they both appeared to fall asleep. The {w|National Air Traffic Controllers Association}, a {w|labor union} representing controllers in the U.S., said safety was their members' "number one priority" and they were "fully committed to providing the safest and most professional services possible." The addition of new staff at control towers, they said, was "a strong first step that will go a long way to ensuring these isolated cases of fatigue never happen again." {w|Paul Rinaldi}, the president of the NATCA, said: "We take our responsibilities very seriously and believe staffing levels and fatigue are at the root of the problem. We will continue to work with the FAA and through our professional standards workgroup to provide the highest level of professionalism and safety."== Sources == 
[[Barry Bonds guilty of obstruction]]The judge declared a mistrial  on three other  obstruction of justice counts, the three charges that Bonds made false statements when he said to a grand jury in December 2003 that he never knowingly used steroids or human growth hormones given to him by  his personal trainer, and that he permitted only doctors to give him injections. The charge that Bonds was convicted of does not mention steroids.The conviction comes after a seven year prosecution of  Bonds, stemming from the investigation of  Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative begun in 2002. Bonds appeared in an advertisement for BELCO which was reportedly selling designer steroids and other drug paraphernalia to professional athletes. Thirty athletes were called to answer questions before the grand jury.  Bonds had been given immunity for his testimony."This case is about upholding one of the most fundamental principles in our system of justice¡ªthe obligation of every witness to provide truthful and direct testimony in judicial proceedings," said federal  prosecutor Melinda Haag.  "In the United States, taking an oath and promising to testify truthfully is a serious matter. We cannot ignore those who choose instead to obstruct justice.

[[Mohamed el-Baradei]]Yes, it is justified. France is a secular country where religion is to be practiced in privacy. It's the law since 1905. Wearing a burqa or a niqab everywhere is clearly an attempt to express you religious belief in public places.In addition, this new law does not ban the religious Muslim veil specifically. The ban is on anything which may fully cover one's face making it impossible for them to be identified. Hence, burqa, niqab and military-like full face hoods are banned. People fully covering their faces will not only be brought to the police station for identification, but will also have to pay a 150 ?uro fine.Going back on the article, it should be clearly stated that the arrested people were only arrested because their protestation was not official. In France, you can protest as much as you'd like, but you must "declare" it first at the town hall.

Both Clinton and Bloomberg will give keynote addresses at the summit, which is attended by the Mayors of many of the world's major cities.== Sources == 
[[Mother of slain Army Ranger calls for removal of General McChrystal from committee]]Immediately after Tillman's death, the Army announced that his death was a result of enemy fire. General Stanley McChrystal authorized the {w|Silver Star} to be awarded to Tillman posthumously with the citation supporting the claim.Reports indicate that McChrystal wrote a memo to President George W. Bush stating "if this becomes public this could be an embarrassment to the administration," referring the the actual details of Tillman's death. Mary Tillman believes there was an effort to cover up the true details of her son's death.Mary Tillman believes McChrystal's handling of the circumstances surrounding the death of her son, makes him unfit to chair a commission that is intended to handle issues regarding military families.The commission is a low-level White House advisory panel, created by first lady Michelle Obama and second lady Jill Biden. General McChrystal's appointment to lead the commission comes less than a year after President Obama fired the former special operations commander from his position as the top commander for all forces in Afghanistan. General McChrystal was fired at that time for making comments to reporters critical of the President and civilian leadership.General McChrystal could not be reached for comment.In a recent press briefing, {w|White House Press Secretary} {w|Jay Carney} was asked what the White House's response was to critics who say General McChrystal should not be on any sort of advisory committee having to do with military families. Carney responded by saying, "[T]he president feels strongly that General McChrystal is the right person to help lead this advisory committee on this vital issue." == Sources == 
[[Japanese nuclear plant operators ordered to compensate affected families amid calls for prime minister to resign]]The operators of the stricken {w|Fukushima I nuclear power plant} in northeast Japan have been ordered to pay compensation to families affected by the ongoing {w|Fukushima I nuclear accidents|crisis} at the site, amid calls for the resignation of the {w|prime minister of Japan|Japanese prime minister} over how he is handling the crisis, which has now been designated on par with the {w|Chernobyl disaster} in 1986.Japanese officials ordered {w|TEPCO} to pay {money|JPY|1|USD|0.011999|GBP|0.007346|units=millions} to each household affected by the crisis, which the company says will add up to approximately {money|JPY|49956|USD|599|GBP|367|units=millions}. Earlier this week, officials announced plans to expand the {w|nuclear exclusion zone} around the plant to include five more communities as radiation continues to leak from the plant. Pressure is now mounting for the resignation of {w|Naoto Kan}, the Japanese prime minister, for his handling of the nuclear crisis in Fukushima; some of his opponents have called for an independent inquiry into how he reacted to the disaster. TEPCO has this week announced plans to move equipment to higher ground after a series of strong {w|aftershock|aftershocks} that have hampered efforts to repair the crippled facility. Officials have warned some of the nuclear rods in the reactors at the plant may have been damaged, but likely remain intact. Workers at the plant are still fighting a desperate battle to stop radiation leaking from the plant, but have been hit by constant setbacks. Earlier this week officials of {w|Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA}, the Japanese government nuclear authority, said officials had upgraded the crisis to a level seven on the {w|International Nuclear Event Scale}¡ªthe same applied to the Chernobyl disaster¡ªdesignating the crisis as a "major accident" with "wider consequences" than previously thought. "We have upgraded the severity level to seven as the impact of radiation leaks has been widespread from the air, vegetables, tap water and the ocean," he said. Emergency workers, dressed in protective white suits, gloves and goggles, have began searching for bodies within the exclusion zone around the stricken nuclear plant, much of which was left muddied and destroyed by the tsunami. Officials fear up to 1,000 bodies may be among the wreckage in the area. Search efforts in the area have been put off because of high radiation levels, but authorities want to recover bodies before they deteriorate to the point where they become a health hazard and impossible to identify.Japanese television reported radiation levels in the ocean off the plant have fallen but remain high. Health officials have found radiation 25 times the legal limit in fish caught south of the nuclear plant, and radioactivity had been detected in 11 different vegetables in Fukushima earlier this week.  The death toll from the disaster is continuing to rise; {w|law enforcement in Japan|Japanese police} have reported 13,300 people have been confirmed dead and more than 15,000 are still missing.Another aftershock, with a magnitude of 6.1, struck on Thursday morning, following a more powerful one, measuring magnitude 6.6, on Monday. {w|List of foreshocks and aftershocks of the 2011 T¨­hoku earthquake and tsunami|Hundreds of aftershocks} have rattled northeast Japan in the month since the initial earthquake. Before the aftershock on Monday, people across Japan marked the one month anniversary of the earthquake with a {w|moment of silence}, and Kan paid tribute to countries who had sent aid to the stricken country. However, Kan has been criticised for his handling of the nuclear crisis. An entrepreneur in {w|Fukushima prefecture|Fukushima}, Yoshihisa Kato, complained about how he had been left abandoned by the government. "I am physically and mentally worn out by the nuclear crisis," he said. "They have done nothing so far to help us."== Sources == 
[[Poverty rises as food prices increase]]The World Bank, an organization that provides loans to developing countries, warned Thursday that rising food prices are driving millions of people deeper into poverty.He warned that a further increase of 10% in the cost of food would move  an additional 10 million persons into extreme poverty, and there was no sign of a near term  reversal  in  the inflation of food prices, which affects the developing world disproportionately. "We have to put food first and protect the poor and vulnerable, who spend most of their money on food,"  said Zoellick. ¡°The general trend lines are ones where we are in a danger zone¡­ because prices have already gone up and [food] stocks are relatively low,¡± he said.The cost of the  {w|Staple food|basic foods}, such as  {w|wheat}, {w|maize} and {w|soy} are all surging. Only {w|rice} has shown a slight decrease in price. The steep rise in the cost of food is being driven by a combination of factors, including bad weather in food exporting areas such as Russia, Ukraine, North America and China,  rising energy costs that increase the cost of producing and transporting food, and the incentives for  farmers in many countries to produce crops for {w|biofuel}s  instead of for food. "The linkage between food and fuel is much tighter than it was ten years ago," said Zoellick.Additionally,  the change in diet of the growing middle class  in developing countries means they  consume more meat and pork products which take increased grain to produce and drives up the price of {w|Fodder|feed stocks}.National food investment and export policies of some wealthier countries are affecting poorer nations. For example, China is acquiring large amounts of land in Africa to grow food for the needs of the Chinese; Saudi Arabia has given up wheat production to invest overseas for food, and a {w|drought} in Russia has led it to implement an export ban on wheat.Zoellick spoke in Washington at the opening of the  meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He hopes to discuss food policies with officials of the {w|G-20 major economies|G-20} countries to develop a "code of conduct" on export bans and to encourage these countries to do more to  increase food production and aid developing countries in managing  agricultural problems.On Saturday, the World Bank and the IMF issued "Global Monitoring Report 2011: Improving the Odds of Achieving the MDGs" which said the world was still on track  toward reaching a key goal of reducing the number of the world's people living in extreme poverty and hunger by half, to  883 million, by the target date of 2015.  Most of the world's progress is due to fast growth in India and China, while African countries are behind.  == Sources == 
[[Former Australian athlete jailed for eighteen years for murdering her baby]]Former Australian {w|water polo} champion {w|Keli Lane}, 36,  received an eighteen year prison term with a non-parole period of thirteen years and five months after being convicted of killing her two-day old daughter, Tegan.The Sydney woman had been in custody since December when she was found guilty of her infant's 1996 murder, despite the fact  the baby¡¯s body was never found. Lane has repeatedly denied any guilt in the murder, maintaining she gave the baby to its biological father, a man she named as either Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris. Although there were extensive police searches, neither man has been located.The trial took seventeen weeks. Around 200 people were present in the New South Wales Supreme Court to watch Justice Anthony Whealy sentence Lane. In his two-hour sentencing remarks, Justice Whealy said he accepted the Crown's claim that Lane had deliberately killed her baby, whom he said had been murdered. "She must have found herself in a desperate situation and could see no way out," he said.Justice Whealey said that Lane did not have a mental illness; rather she had  a {w|personality disorder} that caused her to feel illogically trapped and isolated.  He noted that it was not known how the child died, but said the murder was not premeditated but rather  "spontaneous". He acknowledged that she was only 21 when the crime occurred and  referred to the case as  "the most profound tragedy" on multiple levels.Noting that Lane had been  rehabilitated and was now  a "very different person", he said, "The testimonials demonstrate that Keli has a unique rapport and successful relationship with young children generally."  The judge believed Lane posed no further threat to society and was unlikely to re-offend.== Sources == 
[[Experts raise serious questions over safety of U.S. oil industry and warn another spill may be 'unavoidable']]One year after the Deepwater Horizon disaster which caused the {w|Deepwater Horizon oil spill|largest oil spill} in the history of the petroleum industry and caused huge environmental damage in the {w|Gulf of Mexico}, experts have warned there are serious questions over the safety of deep water drilling as the United States government approves more exploration without improving safety measures.Scientists have raised major concerns over repeated assurances from the industry and the government, who insist lessons have been learned from the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. {w|Charles Perrow}, a professor at {w|Yale University}, said the oil industry "is ill prepared at the least" to deal with another oil spill. "I have seen no evidence that they have marshaled containment efforts that are sufficient to deal with another major spill," he said. While the government has implemented new regulations, technical systems for stopping oil flowing from a leaking well, and increased oversight from oil officials, Perrow said {w|deep water drilling} had become no less dangerous. "I don't think they have found ways to change the corporate culture sufficiently to prevent future accidents," he said. "There are so many opportunities for things to go wrong that major spills are unavoidable." Last year, {w|Doug Inkley}, a scientist at the {w|National Wildlife Federation}, said the culture of an "addiction to oil" was ultimately responsible for the catastrophe. "How long must we wait for lawmakers to act to prevent future disasters? How many more lives, livelihoods and animals must be claimed by our addiction to oil?" Greenpeace also slammed {w|BP}, who ran Deepwater Horizon, for how they allowed the disaster to happen. "The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now," the organization said.However, under pressure from industry executives the administration of president Barack Obama has resumed issuing drilling permits. It is understood regulators are still allowing oil companies to obtain drilling permits before reviewing new spill response plans. "I'm not an oddsmaker, but I would say in the next five years we should have at least one major blowout," Perrow said. "Even if everybody tries very hard, there is going to be an accident caused by cost-cutting and pressure on workers. These are moneymaking machines and they make money by pushing things to the limit."BP has insisted it has changed safety procedures. The oil giant came under heavy criticism for how it handled the crisis, and other major oil companies insisted Deepwater Horizon was a result of a culture exclusive to BP. {w|Michael Bromwich}, the director of the {w|Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement}, the U.S. government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling, said the view was "as disappointing as it is shortsighted," and the issue of deep water safety was "a broad problem."The warnings came as it emerged BP had attempted to take control of an independent study into the environmental consequences of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Internal emails expose how BP executives attempted to influence the study, which was funded by a {w|US$}500m grant from the oil company. The study may be part of the final verdict as to what penalties, fines and criminal charges are brought against the company. Greenpeace, who uncovered the emails through a {w|Freedom of Information Act} request, attacked the reportedly unsuccessful attempts to influence the supposedly independent study as "outrageous".Protesters rallied outside BP's annual conference in London this week, where shareholders met for the first time since the disaster off the Gulf coast. Executives faced questions over their competence and large salaries from angry shareholders, many of whom disapproved of the appointment of {w|Carl-Henric Svanberg} as chairman and {w|Sir Bill Castell} as the head of BP's safety board. Some demonstrators purchased shares in BP in an attempt to get inside the meeting; one woman, a fisherwoman who lives on the {w|Gulf Coast} was arrested after pouring a black substance down herself at the entrance to the conference centre and refusing to move. "I have travelled all the way over from the Gulf Coast and I just wanted to talk those responsible for destroying my community," she said as she was led away by police. "My community is dead. We've worked five generations there and now we've got a dead community. I'm angry, I've been angry a long time."== Sources == 
[[UK to ban export of lethal injection drugs to US]]Britain  announced Thursday  that it will ban the export to the US of three pharmaceutical drugs used for {w|lethal injection|lethal injections} in executions under the death penalty.The three drugs are {w|pentobarbital}, {w|pancuronium bromide} and {w|potassium chloride}. UK Business Secretary Vince Cable said the order will be formalized within the next few days. Cable issued a statement saying, "We oppose the death penalty in all circumstances and are clear that British drugs should not be used to carry out lethal injections. That is why we introduced a control on {w|sodium thiopental} last year¡ªthe first of its kind in the world. And it is also why we are now controlling the export of the other drugs used in lethal injections in the US."Cable said he was requesting all   countries  in the EU to do the same in order to effectively control the export of these drugs.Britain blocked the export  of  sodium thiopental in November after the human rights group {w|Reprieve_#Reprieve_UK|Reprieve} sued the government to stop its exportation to the US. Sodium thiopental had been sold to the {w|Department of Corrections} in two states, Georgia and Arizona, by a small wholesaler in London. The drug is legally used for lethal injections in the US but is in short supply there.Pentobarbital, a sedative, is used to control continuous {w|Status epilepticus|epileptic seizures}, as well as to treat a variety of other medical conditions. After sodium thiopental became scarce in the US late last year,  the US began to use pentobarbital as a substitute.The {w|Death Penalty Information Center} said in December that executions in the US had declined in  2010 compared to previous years, partly as a result of a sodium thiopental shortage.== Sources == 
[[Syrian protests met with crackdown]]Tens of thousands of Syrians took to the streets Friday in cities across the country protesting for freedom. Syria's official news agency reported, "scattered groups of citizens came out to the streets in several areas of the provinces after Friday prayers and chanted slogans calling for freedom without the intervention of security forces." However, protests in {w|Damascus} reportedly turned violent as security forces were said to disperse the crowds with batons and tear gas to prevent protesters reaching the capital's main square."I counted 15 mukhabarat [secret police] busloads," a source reported to Reuters news agency. "They went into the alleyways just north of the square chasing protesters and yelling 'you pimps, you infiltrators, you want freedom? we will give it to you'."Protests in Syria have intensified since mid-March after families of political prisoners held rallies in Damascus and people in {w|Daraa} protested against the arrests of more than a dozen children for anti-regime graffiti. The protests continued as Syria¡¯s President, {w|Bashar al-Assad} failed to lift the emergency law the country has operated under since his Arab Socialist {w|Ba¡¯ath Party} came to power in 1963. The Assad government has met protests with a mixture of minor concessions and force.After a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Berlin, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, "The Syrian government did not meet the legitimate demands of the Syrian people. It is time for the Syrian government to stop its crack down on these people and begin to meet their aspirations." Assad met with a delegation from {w|Daraa|Dara'a} yesterday. The delegation asked for a deadline for their demands to be met. Al Jazeera correspondent Rula Amin said, "It seems from the people in Daraa that the government is seriously trying to contain [the situation in] Daraa because that is where it all started. If they manage to calm the situation in Daraa, the government believes it will be able to contain the situation throughout Syria."== Sources ==

[['Outraged' LaHood unveils plans to tackle fatigued U.S. air traffic controllers]]United States officials have unveiled new plans which require {w|air traffic controllers} to have longer rest periods between shifts after a spate of controllers fell asleep while on duty at airports across the country. Announcing the plans, transport secretary {w|Ray LaHood} said he was "outraged" by the incidents.The new plans, which the {w|Federal Aviation Administration}, the U.S. government agency responsible for aviation, said would be implemented immediately, come after another controller was suspended this week when they fell asleep while directing aircraft near Miami. The incident was the sixth this year; controllers have fallen asleep in Nevada, Washington D.C., and Tennessee. In one incident, two commercial passenger jets landed without any direction from the control tower because the controller on duty had fallen asleep.LaHood said controllers would be required to have a minimum of nine hours rest between shifts, an increase of an hour, and more supervisors would be required during night shifts, and they will be restricted in what shifts they can swap with colleagues. "I don't know when I've ever been madder," LaHood said in a television interview on {w|Fox News Sunday}. "We're not going to stand by and let that happen.""We've taken steps, as of this morning, to begin changing schedules for controllers, to change schedules for managers, and to make sure that controllers cannot switch in and out of their schedules in order for the convenience of them if they are not well-rested," LaHood said. He vowed that he would ensure any controllers falling asleep on duty would face consequences. "On my watch, controllers will not be paid to take naps," he said. "We're not going to allow that."Earlier this week, {w|Hank Krakowski}, the head of air traffic organization at the FAA, resigned from his position after LaHood said the crisis in U.S. control towers was "unacceptable", and vowed to resolve the issue. "I am totally outraged by these incidents," LaHood said. "This is absolutely unacceptable. The American public trusts us to run a safe system." The results of a study on how {w|fatigue} affects controllers will soon be published and the FAA may make changes. But LaHood insisted controllers had to "take personal responsibility" for the safety of aircraft over the U.S., and they should not make irresponsible shift changes which will make them tired and put passengers at risk. He said all the controllers involved in the incidents had been suspended, and could ultimately be sacked. The {w|National Air Traffic Controllers Association}, a {w|labor union} representing controllers in the U.S., said the FAA had their "full support" in implementing the new steps to tackle fatigue.== Sources ==

The only people on board were the driver and the student who was killed, Daniel Viflic. The driver was injured by shrapnel.Viflic was taken to the intensive care unit at the Soroka Medical Center. According to Professor Shaul Sofer, who is the director of the intensive care unit, his condition had been "critical," and his death wasn¡¯t a surprise because shortly after arrival "his brain stopped functioning."However, Sofer explained that "[d]ue to the sensitive nature of the event," the doctors had "continued treatments despite knowing that he had no chance of recovery."Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Hamas, said that the attack on the bus had been unintentional and that they "did not intend to target Israeli school children," going on to say that the road where the incident occurred sees heavy military traffic.

[[UK union ups strike stakes at services for unemployed]]Following on from January's strike, the UK's {w|Public and Commercial Services Union} yesterday took 24 hours strike action in a dispute over working conditions within call centres providing Jobcentre services for the {w|Department for Work and Pensions}. A press release sent Sunday night by Katrine Williams, the Chair of PCS Wales, states 70% of members who voted were in favour of the industrial action.PCS members "suffer oppressive working conditions that simply result in high levels of stress and sickness" according to the union, and points to the 2,779 staff who left Jobcentre Plus call centres since April last year ¨C approximately 20% of the workforce in the 37 Jobcentre Plus offices handling calls from the public ¨C as evidence of the challenging work environment. The union says management is "obsessed with hitting call centre targets at the expense of providing good quality services to the public".The DWP characterises the action differently, stating 75% of staff voted against the strike. According to the DWP staff work under reasonable terms, but "we have to ensure that our service is available when our customers, who include some of the most vulnerable people in the country, need us." To that end the DWP readily admits it uses performance measures to ensure high productivity and performance, their goal is to "deliver value for money for the taxpayer", and they do not have any plans to change the way they do business.A report in the {w|Liverpool Daily Post} cites more than 500 {w|Merseyside} staff on strike, and quotes PCS regional secretary Peter Middleman describing the culture in-place in Jobcentre Plus contact centres as "battery-farmed working practices". Similarly, the {w|Lancashire Telegraph} cites 120 staff on strike at the Cardwell Place call centre and the expectation that 2,500 across the North West of England were expected to take action; Middleman is quoted describing the call centres as "the modern day equivalents of dark, satanic mills where our members are over worked, overly monitored and forced to endure an obsession with arbitrary targets". The DWP reported the union informed them approximately 40% of the 9,000 staff in JSP contact centres would be taking action, which tallied with their own estimates.Face-to-face Jobcentre services were unaffected by yesterday's strike action; the union have announced that this will be followed with an indefinite ban on members working overtime.
[[Standard & Poor's lowers the U.S. credit outlook to 'negative']]U.S.-based {w|Bond credit rating|credit rating} agency {w|Standard & Poor's} announced Monday its decision to downgrade its outlook for the U.S. long-term debt from "stable" to "negative", saying it is not confident the U.S. Congress and {w|Obama administration} will be able to reach an agreement to meaningfully cut the country's fast-growing budget deficit within a two-year framework. Although the U.S. continues to have a top AAA credit rating at the moment, S&P says that there is at least a 33 percent possibility it will lower the country's long-term bond rating within the next two years. The U.S. now has $1.4 trillion budget deficit and a $14.27 trillion debt burden. Currently, payments and interest on the debt consume more than 60 percent of the U.S. {w|gross domestic product} with the amount only expected to grow. The {w|Treasury Department} predicts the country will reach its $14.29 trillion legal debt limit as early as May 16. Congress must vote to raise the debt limit within the next few weeks, or risk defaulting on debt payments. The {w|Obama administration} has said that failure to raise the debt limit will have a disastrous effect on the economy.Last year, {w|President Obama} appointed a debt commission which produced a plan for cutting the country's budget by $3.8 trillion, over ten years, through spending reductions and tax increases. Currently, a bipartisan group of {w|Republican Party|Republicans} and {w|Democratic Party|Democrats} are trying to reach a compromise over this plan. But, negotiations are currently deadlocked. Congress has failed to produce a budget for fiscal year 2011, the first time it has failed to produce a budget in 36 years, leaving  the various appropriation committees no budgetary guidelines to follow.  S&P said, "Because the U.S. has, relative to its AAA peers, what we consider to be very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness, and the path to addressing these is not clear to us, we have revised our outlook on the long-term rating to negative from stable."A decrease in the nation's credit rating would make it more difficult for it to borrow money, and the money it is able to borrow would come at a higher interest rate, further increasing the national debt. The U.S. currently borrows 41 cents of every dollar it spends, according to a report released by the U.S. House of Representatives on January 19.Last week, the International Monetary Fund said the U.S. deficit was causing financial instability around the world. The U.S. stock market closed down 1.5 percent, with trading volume 2.3 percent lower on Monday in light of the announcement.
[[Afghanistan general Stanley McChrystal cleared of wrongdoing]]A Pentagon inquiry has cleared General {w|Stanley McChrystal} of any misconduct after he left his position of commander of the United States forces in Afghanistan after a {w|Rolling Stone} article reported his military aides made belittling comments about government officials.The Rolling Stone article by {w|Michael Hastings|Michael Hastings}, published on June 22, 2010, quoted one of McChrystal¡¯s military aides giving Vice President Joe Biden the nickname "Bite me" and another aide referring to General {w|James L. Jones} as "a clown."President Barack Obama accepted McChrystal's resignation at the release of the article, stating the conduct presented in the article "does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general."The inquiry report stated there was not enough evidence to confirm the events reported in the article and cleared McChrystal, his military aides and civilian advisers of all wrongdoing."Not all of the events at issue occurred as reported in the article," the inspector general¡¯s report stated. "In some instances, we found no witness who acknowledged making or hearing the comments as reported. In other instances, we confirmed that the general substance of an incident at issue occurred, but not in the exact context described in the article."The inspector general¡¯s team interviewed some fifteen people reported to be involved in the incidents, and found contradictory evidence on the comment regarding the vice president.The interviews confirmed that someone had made a comment about Biden and "and that the rejoinder may have included the words 'bite me,'" though the report states investigators "were unable to establish the exact words used or the speaker."Hastings and Rolling Stone editors maintain that the article is truthful, with executive editor Eric Bates stating the article is "accurate in every detail."
[[Security forces open fire on anti-government protestors in Syria]]Unrest continues in Syria as security forces allegedly opened fire on 10,000 anti-government protestors in the city of Homs on Monday night; two were reported as injured.The protest, sparked by the funerals of seventeen anti-government protestors held earlier in the day, resulted in security forces locking-down the city and ordering protestors to disband by 2:30 a.m. local time. Security forces allegedly opened fire at 2:15 a.m., also using tear gas to subdue the crowd. This is the latest in a spate of unrest in the country and the largest protest seen in Homs, Syria's third largest city, since the unrest began a little over a month ago and comes despite an announcement from Syrian President {w|Bashar al-Assad} on Saturday promising the removal of this country's decade-long emergency laws within a week.The Syrian interior ministry has blamed the attack on armed gangs whose objective is to establish a Salafist regime in Syria and describe the unrest as an "armed insurrection."Human rights activists claim this statement indicates a move towards the use of harsher tactics against protestors and estimate more than 200 protesters have already been killed since the beginning of the unrest more than a month ago.In light of the recent deaths, one activist, calling himself Abu Haider, indicated to Al Jazeera that the protestors' objective had changed from reform to regime change.Foreign minister {w|Walid al-Muallem} claims that the reform process is underway and while peaceful protest will be tolerated, disruptive or violent actions will not.== Sources == 
[[Surfer dies at beach in Pichilemu, Chile]]Her body was discovered by fishermen in the area, who called {w|Pichilemu Police} officers, who along with Homicide Brigade of the {w|Investigations Police of Chile} officers, arrived at the place and took the body to the Forensic Medical Service offices in {w|San Fernando, Chile|San Fernando}.Tapia had been practicing surfing for years, and earlier that day, had been accompanied with her friends. "A shellfish diver of the area noticed a surfboard floating, he approached it and saw that the girl [Tapia] was semisubmerged in the water. After taking her out, he realized she was dead," Juan Reyes, officer of the Homicide Brigade of PDI told {w|Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile}.According to reports, Tapia either died because of a heart attack or after being hit. Third-party participation in her death was ruled out by officers."She had a free spirit, she loved nature, and I don't really know what happened to her, a cramp [maybe]," Filippo Tapia, her father, told {w|La Tercera}. Josefa Tapia, her 14-year-old sister who is studying at Colegio Preciosa Sangre, seemed very affected by her death after being informed of the situation by school inspectors."Your sister will always be watching out and protecting you from heaven, remember the moments you and your family lived with her ??and that made ??you happy," a friend of Josefa wrote on her Facebook wall.Photos, videos, and messages such as "Paulita, rest in peace with love, I'll miss you a lot, great waves and farewell forever," and "My friend, I know you are in a better place having a really good time, you're the best!

[[France, Italy, UK sending military advisers to Libya; photojournalists killed in Misrata]]France and Italy have announced along with the United Kingdom that they will be sending military advisers to help Libyan rebels in their fight against the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.Italian Minister for Defence {w|Ignazio La Russa} said Wednesday that his country will send ten instructors. French officials said they would send fewer than ten. The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said they would send a team that could possibly contain up to twenty advisers.La Russa said in a news conference that the advisers' roles had yet to be determined, "They won't be on the battlefield. They'll be mentors, they won't accompany them. Training is one thing, participation another." He further said of the rebels, "They're rich in enthusiasm, they want to fight for liberty, but naturally they are poor in experience and arms." However, La Russa believes that not all the arms the rebels have were taken from the {w|Libyan Army} stockpiles, stating, "I don't think they only have arms from the Gaddafi army. Some help arrived." He did not elaborate on the final statement.      Meanwhile, U.S. officials say President Barack Obama's administration plans to give the Libyan opposition {w|USD|$}25 million in non-lethal assistance. The officials say the assistance could include items such as vehicles, fuel trucks, protective vests and non-secure radios.Libya's foreign minister, {w|Abdul Ati al-Obeidi}, criticized the dispatch of foreign military advisers, saying it will harm chances for peace in the  country.  In an interview with the BBC, Obeidi called for a ceasefire  followed by a six month period to prepare for an election. "We think any military presence is a step backwards, and we are sure that if this bombing stopped and there is a real ceasefire we could have a dialogue among all Libyans about what they  want ¡ª democracy, political reform, constitution, election. This could not be done with what is going on now," said Obeidi.The move comes as UN officials condemn the use of {w|cluster bombs} that are in use by pro-Gaddaffi forces, a tactic banned under the {w|Convention on Cluster Munitions}, of which Libya is not a signatory. Meanwhile, fighting has continued between rebel and pro-government forces this Wednesday in the besieged western port city of {w|Misrata}, where residents are pleading for international intervention. British photojournalist {w|Tim Hetherington}, who co-directed the documentary film {w|Restrepo}, which was nominated for an {w|Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature} this year, died from wounds he suffered in an {w|Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG} attack in the city. His colleagues, photographers {w|Chris Hondros} and Guy Martin were also severely wounded. Hondros suffered a severe brain injury leaving him in a critical condition and eventually succumbed to his injury at a triage center and Martin, a British citizen, was injured by shrapnel, and is now receiving vascular surgery. Another with the group, Michael Christopher Brown also received shrapnel wounds which were not life-threatening. Hetherington last updated his Twitter account on Tuesday, which read, "In besieged Libyan city of Misrata. Indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces. No sign of NATO."Leaders in the rebel-held city called  for the urgent intervention of foreign ground troops to protect the  500,000 civilians there, the first  such request by anyone among Libya's  opposition forces. The rebels' civilian leadership, the Transitional National Council, has however rejected the presence of foreign troops on Libyan soil to help  their cause.Meanwhile, across the country, NATO airstrikes again struck government installations in several cities. == Sources == 
[[Riot at Sydney, Australia's Villawood Detention Centre continues]]A riot at Sydney's Villawood Detention Centre continued Thursday with six protesters remaining on the roof after the centre was set alight Wednesday night in a protest involving up to 100 detainees. Nobody has been injured in the protest.Nine demountable buildings were destroyed in the blaze, described as an "act of desperation" from asylum-seekers held at the centre for up to two years. Firefighters were pelted with roof tiles and other debris as they struggled to contain the fire. The protest began early Wednesday, sparked by two men climbing onto the roof of the building. The remaining detainees are sitting on the roof with a large sign that reads "We need help." According to one protestor, further violence is unlikely to occur, but they will continue to stay on the roof.Riot police were seen entering the building at approximately 9.30 a.m. {w|AEST}.Villawood has been the site of much recent controversy, with a similar protest taking place in September last year following the death of a Fijian detainee, and a second death in November that led to a hunger strike at the centre.== Sources == 
[[Netanyahu pushed previous prime minister Olmert to attack Iran, according to Wikileaks cables]]Israeli Prime Minister {w|Benjamin Netanyahu} actively pushed for a military strike on Iran, according to a report published in the Israeli newspaper {w|Haaretz} on Thursday.A document revealed by Wikileaks, dated July 20, 2007, shows that Mr. Netanyahu, leader of the {w|Likud} party, urged an attack on Iran in exchange for joining the government at the time, led by {w|Ehud Olmert}.Mr. Netanyahu's request was made as part of discussions to form a government of national unity between Likud and Mr. Olmert's {w|Kadima} party, according to the leaked cable, classified as "confidential" and penned by Marc. J. Sievers, who was at the US embassy in Tel Aviv as a political counselor.An advisor to Mr. Netanyahu told American officials at the time that the Likud leader was willing to take the post of foreign minister, while Mr. Olmert would have become prime minister. However, Mr. Netanyahu demanded military action against Iran as the price for his participation in the proposed coalition. According to the advisor cited in the US cable, Mr. Netanyahu urged the Kadima leader to "galvanize Israel for action against Iran."Israel has previously entertained the possibility of military strikes to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear weapons capability. In November 2010, Iran announced uranium enrichment activities had been disrupted by the {w|Stuxnet} computer virus. The Iranian government later accused the US and Israel of responsibility for the malware.Israel and Western powers have accused Iran, whose president, {w|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad}, has called for Israel to be "wiped off the map," of seeking to obtain nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear program.== Sources ==

[[Sheffield United relegated from English Football League Championship]]Despite pre-season hopes of a {w|Football League Championship play-offs|play-off} place, 'The Blades' have been stuck in a fight for Championship survival for the majority of the season, which has been the result of three managerial changes in the period of just 8 months. Currently lead by former {w|Port Vale F.C.} boss, {w|Micky Adams}, results have continued to be generally poor in 2011 - despite the departure of  {w|Gary Speed}.The South Yorkshire football club controversially began a legal dispute with London-based {w|West Ham United F.C.} in 2007 following {w|The Football Association}'s decision not to deduct Sheffield's relegation rivals  points for ineligibly fielding {w|Carlos T¨¦vez}. Since then, numerous attempts to return to the {w|Barclays Premier League} have been unsuccessful, including a play-off final hosted at {w|Wembley Stadium|Wembley} in 2009.Speaking after today's game, a downhearted Micky Adams remarked: "I'm obviously devastated. There's a lot of disappointed players in the changing rooms today and I think they have every right to be disappointed. The team's a genuine hard-working group but they've just not been good enough. We have to share responsibility and I'll take mine".Adams admitted he "can't say" whether he will still be in charge next season, though was adamant that he "wants to be the manager who brings them [United] back".United will play in the {w|Football League One|Npower League 1} for the 2011/12 football season. As this was not Sheffield's last game of the campaign, the club could still move down to 23rd place, but cannot achieve a place outside the relegation zone.Perhaps ironically, this event comes almost a year after cross-city rivals {w|Sheffield Wednesday} were relegated from the same division, meaning that next season will host the first Steel City Derby in the third tier of English football since 1980.
[[All US states could have smoke-free laws by 2020]]Government officials have predicted that by 2020, all US states will have bans on indoor smoking in private sector bars and restaurants, the chief sources of {w|Passive smoking|secondhand smoke}, if the current rate of progress in enacting smoking bans continues. In a press release issued yesterday, the {w|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention} reported that by December 31, 2010 there were 26 states with broad indoor smoking bans, covering workplaces, bars and restaurants, while an additional 10 states had banned smoking in one or two specific indoor areas.  Cumulatively, these restriction cover almost one half of the country's population, 47.8 percent,  while a remaining 88 million nonsmokers  are still exposed to secondhand smoke yearly, including half of all children over three years old.In comparison, in 2000 there were no states that had broad indoor smoking bans. Some states have enacted less restrictive laws, such as requiring separate ventilation systems for smoking areas. Southern and western  states are lagging in implementing smoking bans. Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina have banned smoking in  two of the three sectors. Currently there are only  seven states having no state wide restrictions on  indoor smoking, although some have local ordinances.  These are Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming, according to the CDC. The full report was published in this week's {w|Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report}.Secondhand smoke is a known cause of a number of diseases including  lung cancer and heart disease. The {w|Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General's} report of 2010 says, "tobacco smoke damages every organ in the body, resulting in disease and death." {QuoteRight|Completely prohibiting smoking in all public places and workplaces is the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure.|source=Ursula Bauer, CDC}In the press release, Ursula Bauer of the CDC, said that secondhand smoke  is the cause of 46,000 heart disease deaths and 3,400 lung cancer deaths yearly in  nonsmokers. "Completely prohibiting smoking in all public places and workplaces is the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure," she said. Dr. {w|Thomas R. Frieden}, director of the CDC said, "Eliminating smoking from work sites, restaurants and bars is a low-cost, high-impact strategy that will protect nonsmokers and allow them to live healthier, longer, more productive lives while lowering health care costs associated with secondhand smoke."The {w|American Heart Association} issued a statement: "We must zero in on those areas that continue to lag despite studies that show smoke-free policies benefit {w|public health} and the local economy with lower health care costs." Gary Nolan of the Smokers Club, a smoker's rights group, said, "It wouldn't surprise me if they prevailed." He noted that heavy  pressure is being applied to bars and restaurants by public health officials to ban smoking. "It's just a little bit more liberty slipping away at the hands of big government." == Sources == 
[[Amazon server outage affects Reddit, other websites]]The outage, which occurred at Amazon's northern Virginia {w|data center}, affected some of the company's US EC2 clients for much of the day. EC2, which hosts thousands of websites, is an {w|elastic computing|elastic} {w|cloud computing} platform.Quora, an online {w|knowledge market}, was taken offline by the outage. Reddit, a {w|social news} site, was accessible by mid-Thursday, but was still running at limited functionality. Location-based social network Foursquare experienced disruptions in service early Thursday, but appeared to have resumed normal operation by the afternoon. Other sites, such as Hootsuite and {w|SCVNGR}, displayed error messages instead of their normal home pages.Amazon has experienced outages before, including one in 2008 that lasted two hours due to technical problems at a data center. The company did not comment on the cause or scope of Thursday's outage, but continued to post public updates on its health dashboard. By Thursday evening, Amazon said it had resolved most of the issues affecting EC2, but one service availability zone had still not recovered.

[[Murderer of road accident victim sentenced to death]]Yao Jiaxin, a 21-year-old student at the Xi'an Conservatory of Music, was sentenced to death on Friday. Yao, from {w|Xi'an} in China's {w|Shaanxi province}, was convicted of homicide after stabbing a cyclist to death.On the night of October 20, 2010, Yao ran into 26-year-old cyclist and mother of a two-year-old, Zhang Miao, while driving his car. After he saw her writing down his vehicle's license plate number following the accident, he feared she would report him, and proceeded to murder her by stabbing her six times.  Prior to her murder, Zhang had suffered only minor injuries in the accident, according to police.On October 23, after being accused of murdering her, Yao went to the local police station with his parents and confessed to the crime. He said he killed Zhang because she had seen his license plate number, and he feared that the "peasant woman would be hard to deal with."During a three-hour trial on March 23, 2011, Yao's lawyer pleaded for a lenient sentence, saying it was a "crime of passion."  Yao tearfully described how he had been forced to play the piano, leading him to thoughts of suicide. But prosecutors and judges said Yao did not deserve leniency, as he had not attempted to help the woman after the accident but instead murdered her. Public passions were raised and some thought Yao would get off through the influence of his family. The case triggered a public debate over the {w|death penalty}. "The motive is extremely despicable ... the measures are extremely cruel ... and the consequence is extremely serious," said the court in its judgment.== Sources == 
[[UK newspapers face libel, privacy action over murder coverage]]Six UK newspapers are facing actions claiming libel and breach of privacy from Chris Jeffries, a man who attracted intense media coverage when arrested in December for the {w|murder of Joanna Yeates}. Jeffries was subsequently released and a different man has been charged instead.Lawyer Louis Charalambous says Jeffries "seek[s] vindication of his reputation for the terrible treatment he received" from six newspapers ¨C {W|The Sun}, {W|The Daily Mirror}, {W|The Daily Star}, {W|The Daily Express}, {w|The Daily Mail}, and {W|The Daily Record}. The papers all covered the man's arrest following the discovery of a body near the Clifton area of Bristol, England, on Christmas Day; Yeates had been missing from her flat since December 17. Jeffries was the flat's landlord.Another man who shared the Clifton address ¨C Vincent Tabak ¨C was later arrested when police eliminated Jeffries from any involvement with the murder. Tabak's next court appearance is set for May 4 and the trial is scheduled to take place in October. Media coverage of Jeffries attracted criticism at the time; Roy Greenslade wrote for {W|The Guardian} that the suspect was facing "a character assassination" and {W|Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General} {W|Dominic Grieve} warned papers they may be in breach of {w|contempt of court} legislation. Although no prosecutions have been launched to date, Grieve recently succeeded in an action claiming contempt of court by two of the papers targeted by Jeffries ¨C The Sun and The Daily Mail ¨C over their coverage of a different murder.In addition to the six national papers that have received writs, action is anticipated against several local papers. "Mr Jefferies will not be making any statement about these claims until their conclusion, which he hopes will be in the very near future," according to his legal team at solicitors Simons Muirhead and Burton.Charalambous has previously sued all the papers except The Daily Record - alongside {W|The Sunday Express}, {W|The London Evening Standard}, {W|Metro|Metro}, {W|The Sunday Mirror}, {W|The News of the World} and {W|The Scotsman} - while representing Robert Murat, over in excess of 100 "seriously defamatory" articles linking him to the {W|disappearance of Madeleine McCann}.

[[Apple collecting location data from iPhone, iPad]]Apple Inc.'s {w|iPhone} and {w|iPad} periodically send location information back to the company, according to new reports. The data is transmitted to a secure database that only it can access, Apple claims.Bruce Sewell, an attorney for Apple, sent a letter to two US Representatives last year, discussing the company's data collection techniques and policies. The thirteen-page letter states that location information is recorded and sent to Apple every twelve hours, but only if the user enables the device's location settings.Apple began building a location database of its own when it decided to stop using similar services offered by Google & {w|SkyHook Wireless}. Location data is used in social networking applications and call routing.In a statement to the Associated Press,  {w|Democratic Party|Democratic} Massachusetts Representative {w|Edward Markey} said, "Apple needs to safeguard the personal location information of its users to ensure that an iPhone doesn't become an iTrack."Such data collection is not unique to Apple. Google's {w|Google Android|Android} operating system uses similar technology to provide location-based services to its users. Google has said that it also uses the data collected to provide accurate traffic data through its "Maps" applications on both Apple and Android devices. However, the company declined to comment on the latest findings regarding its data collection.Apple was also recently in the spotlight after it was discovered that the iPhone and iPad were retaining location data on the device itself. This information is collected in an unencrypted file and is not transmitted elsewhere. The data file reportedly contains a variety of information, including {w|longitude} and {w|latitude}, cell phone tower identification data, wireless hotspot identification, and timestamps.
[[Massachusetts study finds links between bullying and family violence]]Both {w|School bullying|bullies} and their victims are linked with an increased incidence of violence in the home, according to a report on Massachusetts middle and high school students released on Thursday.In a survey of 5,807 students in 138 schools covering incidents in the past year,  about 25 percent  of middle school students and 16 percent of high school students  reported being bullied  at school.Between 13 to 15 percent of victims of bullying said they had  seen violence in their families  or been physically injured by a family member during the same time frame.Students who were  identified as  being both bullied and victimized by a bully were the most likely to report they had been physically injured by a family member, compared to those who said they were neither a victim nor a bully. They also reported a higher frequency of  {w|suicidal ideation} or attempted suicide  than victims or bullies who were not bully-victims."Sometimes, people who we have thought of as perpetrators are actually very vulnerable themselves," said John Auerbach, Commissioner of {w|Massachusetts Department of Public Health} whose agency collected {w|Statistical survey|survey data} on  5,807 middle and high school students for the study.  The results,  analyzed  by the {w|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention} and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, also confirmed prior findings that bulling is associated  with an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, poor grades and drug abuse. The CDC said the report is the first  detailed, state-level analysis of the risk factors  for school bullying. Last year a  15-year-old Massachusetts student {w|Suicide of Phoebe Prince|Phoebe Prince} of {w|South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley} committed suicide, focusing the state on the issue of bullying. In May 2010 Massachusetts passed legislation outlawing bullying in school and online, outlining procedures for the investigation and reporting of bullying, and establishing school programs to prevent retaliation. This study was completed a year later.   The finding that there is a link between bullying and family violence shows the importance of involving families in programs and strategies addressing bullying. "A comprehensive approach that encompasses school officials, students and their families is needed to prevent bullying among middle school and high school students," said CDC researchers.== Sources == 
[[California employees owe state US$13.3 million in unpaid loans]]The California {w|California State Controller|Controller's} office reports that eleven state agencies have given US$13.3 million in pay and travel advances that have not been collected.Governor {w|Jerry Brown} issued an executive order to recover uncollected loans by the agencies. A press release from the governor's office states, "The Governor¡¯s Executive Order seeks to recover taxpayer dollars by directing state agencies and departments to clear salary and travel advances within 30 days through an expense claim." Any outstanding balance will be deducted from employees' paychecks under the governor's order after the 30 days.Under California state law, state employees are permitted to receive advances for hardship, travel, and other circumstances. These advances cannot be collected by agencies after three years without the employee's consent.State Controller John Chiang said in a statement, "The state¡¯s poor debt collection and accounting practices are fleecing public coffers at a time when vital public programs are being decimated by unprecedented budget cuts." Chiang's office expects there will be more money unaccounted for, including some from the {w|California Highway Patrol}. California state law mandates that anyone convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol is required to pay for the investigation. The CHP has not collected this money.The {w|Caltrans|California Department of Transportation}, also called Caltrans, has the largest debt of the eleven agencies: $3.2 million. {w|California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|Cal Fire}, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, "had an outstanding balance of $1.44 million as of June 30, 2008. An overwhelming portion of that balance was related to employee salary and travel advances," according to a controller's office audit.Chiang's office had informed former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger there were outstanding debts, but Schwarzenegger's administration did not take action.All eleven agencies have agreed to hand over any delinquent accounts to the controller's office, who will collect these debts.== Sources == 
[['Apple's data is dirtiest,' says Greenpeace]]In a report on {w|cloud computing} issued this week, the environmental group Greenpeace rated ten top Internet companies, including Apple, Google, Twitter and {w|Amazon}, on several factors such as each company's willingness to be transparent by providing information on its energy sources and the {w|Efficient energy use|energy efficiency} of its {w|Data center|data centers}.In the report entitled "How Dirty is your Data", Apple, while receiving good marks for transparency, rated at the bottom for energy efficiency, primarily because its huge, new data center in North Carolina, called iDataCenter, relies largely on coal. Although Apple claimed its California operations used {w|Sustainable energy|cleaner energy} than that produced by most {w|Electrical grid|grids}, iDataCenter has an estimated energy demand three times Apple's current use, significantly increasing Apple's {w|Carbon footprint|environmental footprint}. As Apple increases the online products it delivers from its {w|iTunes} platform, it will enlarge its cloud computing operations further. "Apple's decision to locate its iDataCenter in North Carolina, which has an electrical grid among the dirtiest in the country, indicates a lack of a corporate commitment to clean energy supply for its cloud operations," Greenpeace said in its report. About 2 percent of worldwide energy use is consumed by data center computer servers, and this amount is increasing by 12 percent a year, Greenpeace reports, an energy demand that is more than that of Russia. Greenpeace said many {w|Information technology|IT companies} do not reveal the environmental impact of their energy consumption, and concentrate more on energy efficiency that on using clean energy. Most of their energy is supplied by coal and nuclear energy. Companies are locating their data centers in areas that afford cheap, abundant coal-powered electricity.Yahoo was praised by Greenpeace for placing its data centers near sources of clean energy and its minor use of coal-based power. Greenpeace noted that Google says that it is conscious of the need to use renewable sources of electricity to power cloud computing, but it does not acknowledge the size of its {w|carbon footprint}. The company claims it has seven data centers worldwide, but it is estimated to have 20 to 30.The carbon footprint of cloud computing is a recent emphasis of Greenpeace in its attempt to disprove the belief that the biggest {w|Pollution|polluters} are {w|Manufacturing|manufacturers}. In a response to the report, Timothy Prickett Morgan criticized Greenpeace for focusing on data centers which are responsible for using about 3 per cent of the US power generation and globally account for 1.5 to 2 percent. He noted that "the data centers of Amazon, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Apple, and Akamai . . . are probably not much different from the business where you work every day when it comes to dependency on coal for electricity generation. And ditto for the home that you return to every night."Morgan quotes data from a 2008 report by the {w|International Energy Agency} and cited  by the World Coal Association, now known as the {w|The World Coal Institute}, that showed coal plants produce over 40 percent of the global electricity. The Institute determined that United States receives half of its power from coal plants. Some other countries, such as South Africa, Poland and China, use more coal. "The world is still dependent on non-renewable energy sources ¨C coal and nuclear with a smattering of oil and gas ¨C to generate electricity," he says, suggesting the IT companies should not be singled out. Morgan is also critical of Greenpeace's methodology in gathering the data, as it included only a sample of the data centers of these companies, and some that were not yet completely operational. He noted that because the companies were not always cooperative in disclosing information, Greenpeace estimated a portion of the data. He said that the reader has to "drill down into the report" to see the the complete picture. Another criticism of Greenpeace is its definition of coal and nuclear power as "dirty energy". Because it does not discharge greenhouse gases, nuclear power is rated more favorably than coal by some environmental organizations. Greenpeace is adamantly against nuclear power's radiation risks.== Sources ==

[[U.S. Coast Guard investigation finds 'poor safety culture' contributed to Deepwater Horizon disaster]]An investigation by the {w|United States Coast Guard} has concluded the {w|Deepwater Horizon oil spill|largest oil spill} in the history of the petroleum industry was partly the result of a "poor safety culture" aboard the {w|Deepwater Horizon} oil rig. The April 2010 explosion aboard the rig, which is located in the {w|Gulf of Mexico}, triggered a disaster that led to widespread environmental damage.The report squarely blames {w|Transocean}, which managed the Deepwater Horizon, for being largely responsible for the {w|Deepwater Horizon explosion|explosion} that claimed eleven lives. The rig had "serious safety management system failures and a poor safety culture," the report says. Transocean fiercely rejected allegations that crews aboard the rig were badly trained and equipment was poorly maintained.A slapdash safety environment on Deepwater Horizon would mean equipment was not mended or replaced if it meant losing valuable hours of drilling, the Coast Guard found. Electrical equipment believed to have caused a spark that ignited {w|flammable gas} was described as being in "bad condition" and "seriously corroded." The report found that other deficiencies¡ªimproperly assembled {w|gas detectors} and emergency equipment; audible alarms switched off because of nuisance false warnings; complacency with fire drills; and poor preparation for dealing with a {w|well blowout}¡ªall contributed to the disaster.Transocean attacked the report's conclusions and suggested the Coast Guard may have played a role in the disaster. A spokesperson for the company said Deepwater Horizon had been inspected by Coast Guard officials only months before the explosion, officials who said it complied with safety standards. "We strongly disagree with¡ªand documentary evidence in the Coast Guard's possession refutes¡ªkey findings in this report," the company said.This week, Deepwater Horizon owner {w|BP} launched legal action against Transocean. It also filed a lawsuit against {w|Halliburton}, the company that cemented the well, and {w|Cameron}, which manufactured the rig's failed {w|blowout preventer}. BP is reportedly seeking to claim {w|US$}40 billion in {w|damages}, and alleges it has taken a massive financial hit and loss of reputation. In a statement, BP said it filed the lawsuits "to ensure that all parties ... are appropriately held accountable for their roles in contributing to the Deepwater Horizon accident".In the lawsuit against Transocean, BP claims the company missed signs that a disaster was imminent and that it "materially breached its contractual duties in its actions and inactions leading to the loss of well control, the explosion and the loss of life and injuries onboard the Deepwater Horizon, as well as the resulting oil spill." Halliburton, BP alleges, was riddled with "improper conduct, errors and omissions, including fraud and concealment" which led to the disaster, and continues to refuse to cooperate with investigators. Transocean dismissed the lawsuit as "desperate" and "unconscionable," and announced a {w|countersuing|countersuit} against BP, which it claims was responsible for the disaster "through a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk, in some cases severely." Halliburton and Cameron, which is also countersuing, announced they would defend themselves against BP's allegations.U.S. President Barack Obama marked the anniversary of the explosion by conceding that although "progress" has been made to ensure the safety of deep water drilling rigs, "the job isn't done." Obama's comments came less than a week after leading experts raised serious questions over the security of {w|deep water drilling} as the U.S. government approves more exploration without improving safety measures. However, politicians have insisted they are doing all they can to help clean the coast of oil. "Cleanup efforts in some places are still ongoing, and the full scale of the damage done to our state has yet to be calculated, but the good news is that most all of our fishing waters are back open again," said Louisiana Governor {w|Bobby Jindal} at a press conference. "All of us here today want the entire nation to get the message that Louisiana is making another historic comeback."Gulf Coast residents, activists and relatives of the crewmen who were killed in the explosion paused this week for the anniversary of the oil spill's beginning. A helicopter took the victims' families from {w|New Orleans} to over the site where the rig stood, where it circled. "It was just a little emotional, seeing where they were," said one victim's mother. Remembrance services and candlelight {w|vigils} were held in the Gulf Coast region, which continues to suffer from the fallout of the catastrophe. The families have expressed anger at BP, who they say is being unfair and slow in paying out compensation from a $20 billion fund. The area is still heavily affected by the disaster and reconstruction of the seafood industry that once thrived is slow. While tourists are beginning to return to the region, many are angry at BP and the {w|Obama administration} over how they handled the disaster. All the fishing waters in the area have now opened again, but people who live in the area remain dissatisfied. "I don't see any daylight at the end of this tunnel," one fisherwoman said. "I don't see any hope at all. We thought we'd see hope after a year, but there's nothing."== Sources == 
[[U.S. drones enter Libya conflict]]The first attacks carried out by United States {w|Predator drones} in Libya reportedly occurred today, as the {w|The Pentagon|Pentagon} confirmed a strike carried out by the {W|U.S. Air Force} but declined to give further details.According to Pentagon spokesperson Darryn James, a captain in the {w|U.S. Navy}, the attack happened sometime Saturday, but withheld other information. According to the Pentagon, "common practice" regarding drone operations is to provide no more information than to confirm an attack. NATO later revealed the target was a {w|multiple rocket launcher} in the {w|Misrata} area. A statement from NATO said that, "[t]he MRL system had been used against civilians in Misrata."General {w|James Cartwright}, an official with the {w|U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff}, said that drones have an "ability to get down lower and therefore, to be able to get better visibility, particularly on targets that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions," a benefit in Libya, where pro-Gaddafi forces are increasingly taking cover near civilian populations. Drones are able to make more precise attacks, which lowers the risk of civilian casualties in such areas.== Sources == 
[[Tornadoes damage hundreds of Missouri homes, force closure of airport]]An {w|Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF4} tornado struck near {w|St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis}, Missouri Friday night, forcing the closure of {w|Lambert-St. Louis International Airport} and damaging over 2,700 buildings in {w|St. Louis County}. The {w|National Weather Service} also confirmed that an EF1 tornado touched down in neighboring {w|St. Charles County} and an EF2 touched down in {w|Pontoon Beach, Illinois}.The city of {w|Bridgeton, Missouri|Bridgeton}, in North St. Louis County, was hit by the EF4 tornado. According to the National Weather Service, it was the most powerful tornado to touch down in the St. Louis region since 1967, with winds ranging from 166 and 200 miles per hour. Aftereffects of that tornado were also reported in {w|Maryland Heights, Missouri}.One official estimated that anywhere from 50 to 200 homes in the Maryland Heights and Bridgeton areas incurred damage, but early numbers released by St. Louis County indicate that over 2,000 buildings in those two cities had suffered "noticeable damage," which does not include minor damage. Around 30,000 people in the region did not have power Saturday, out of a total of 47,000 affected residents.Authorities with {w|search and rescue dog|search and rescue dogs} went door-to-door Saturday, looking for possibly trapped residents. Aerial imagery was being used in damage assessment. Area residents unaffected by the tornado were assisting those that lost their homes, reported St. Louis television station {w|KSDK}.The Harmann Estates neighborhood of Bridgeton was heavily damaged during the storm, with many residences losing roofs and siding. Officials have already condemned some of the subdivision's homes. St. Louis {w|County Executive} {w|Charlie Dooley} reported 25 homes in Bridgeton and {w|Berkeley, Missouri} as being completely destroyed and an additional 35 as uninhabitable.The storm also caused the temporary shutdown of two major St. Louis highways. Portions of {w|Interstate 70} and {w|Interstate 270} were closed Friday night due to fallen power lines and storm debris. Both blocked sections have since reopened, but officials said it would take a few days to remove all the debris, which they pushed onto the roadsides.Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, which is immediately west of Berkeley, suffered heavy damage Friday night from the same tornado, and was forced to halt all regular operations Saturday while crews worked to clear the affected terminals. Eight flights had been forced to land in {w|Kansas City, Missouri} Friday night due to the tornado. About 500 people were in Lambert Airport when the tornado hit. A {w|Federal Aviation Administration} spokesperson said other US airports were not affected by Lambert's shutdown. Lambert is not an {w|airline hub} and is significantly less busy than it was ten years ago.In a Saturday press conference, Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge, Lambert's director, said the airfield and Terminal 2 were "fully functional," but the main terminal's Concourse C had been severely impacted by the storm. That terminal, which sustained the heaviest damage, serves {w|Air Tran}, {w|American Airlines}, {w|Cape Air}, and {w|Frontier Airlines}. The total cost of repairs at Lambert is expected to be in the millions of dollars, but Hamm-Niebruegge said the airport does not yet have a good estimate.One passenger of a waiting plane at Lambert told {w|KSDK} that heavy winds pushed the aircraft about 20 feet while it was still attached to the gate. Two other planes on the tarmac were unable to return to the airport, so passengers were bused back. Five planes¡ªfour operated by American and one by {w|Southwest Airlines}¡ªsuffered damage, and some will undergo major repairs.Some travelers inside the airport received medical attention for minor injuries caused by flying glass. A handful of people were transported to a local hospital for additional treatment, but all were later released. "We get to the terminal and lights were out, glass everywhere, blood everywhere from people had been cut," recalled one witness. Another person at the airport reported, "The ceiling was falling. The glass was hitting us in the face. Hail and rain were coming in. The wind was blowing debris all over the place. It was like being in a horror movie. Grown men were crying."On Saturday, it was evident that Concourse C would not be open for some time, said {w|Mayor of St. Louis} {w|Francis Slay}. A large section of its roof was missing and around half of its windows had been blown out by the high winds. Debris and water from the storm were present inside the airport as crews worked to restore power and assess damage to the terminal. Missing windows had been boarded up, ruined carpet had been removed, and the control tower was functional by Saturday afternoon. The power was back on by 7:40 p.m. {w|Central Daylight Time|CDT} that evening.The airport resumed outgoing flight services Sunday, although several incoming flights landed at Lambert Saturday evening. Slay said the airport will be running at 70 percent capacity until mid-week, depending on the availability of airline crew members and planes. Airlines using Concourse C will have their operations temporarily relocated, he added. On Sunday, Southwest was operating at normal capacity, while AirTran moved to Concourse B and canceled four of its eleven scheduled flights. A spokesperson for American said the airline would have planes ready for normal Monday operations. American had previously canceled all St. Louis flights scheduled for Sunday.On Saturday afternoon, {w|Governor of Missouri|Missouri Governor} {w|Jay Nixon} arrived at Lambert and visited areas devastated by the tornado. He originally planned to tour Maryland Heights, Bridgeton, and Berkeley, but Nixon was only able to tour Berkeley due to an approaching line of storms. While in St. Louis, the governor said 750 Missouri homes had been damaged by Friday's tornadoes and that federal assistance was forthcoming. Nixon reported that the {w|Federal Emergency Management Agency} was involved in assessing storm damage, as well as that {w|US President} Barack Obama had already contacted him, promising relief funds. {w|US Representative} {w|William Lacy Clay, Jr.|Lacy Clay}, said Saturday that he would brief Obama on the situation.The state declared the affected areas of St. Louis County a disaster area. No one has reported serious injuries or deaths as a result of the storm, although some people were treated for minor injuries. "It was horrific and for that much damage to been done, to have no loss of life, is truly a blessing," Slay said.== Sources == 
[[Qur'an-burning pastor jailed after mosque protest barred]]A controversial Florida pastor who had planned a demonstration outside a Michigan mosque Friday evening was briefly jailed after a court decided the protest would cause a breach of the peace and he refused to post a "peace bond" of {w|US$}1 required by the judge. Fifty-nine-year-old Terry Jones, the pastor of a small church in {w|Gainesville, Florida} whose burning of the {w|Qur'an} sparked deadly protests in Afghanistan earlier this month, was denied a permit to stage a protest against "radical Islam" in front of the {w|Islamic Center of America} in {w|Dearborn, Michigan}, where one of the largest communities of Muslims in the US is located. Dearborn police cited concerns about violence and offered alternate sites for the protest, which Jones rejected, saying his protest would go ahead as planned.Prosecutors, concerned about possible violence, went to court on  Thursday to obtain a ruling from Dearborn District Judge Mark Somers to prevent the protest. Somers conducted a one-day trial on Friday. At the trial, Jones argued that any limitations on his planned protest violated his free speech rights protected by the {w|First Amendment} of the {w|US Constitution}. "The First Amendment is only valid if it allows us to say what other people may not like," Jones said in court. "Otherwise, we do not need the First Amendment."The six-person jury reached the verdict that Jones was "likely to breach the peace" if he went ahead with his demonstration.Prosecutors requested the judge require a $25,000 bond. Judge Somers ordered Jones and supporter Wayne Sapp, 42, to pay a $1 peace bond and agree to stay away from the mosque for a period of three years. "The peace bond is to prohibit free speech," said Sapp. Both initially refused to pay the peace bond and were remanded to the county jail. Prosecutors said that if they refused to pay, they might be jailed for up to three years.  Both later paid the bond and were released.The American Civil Liberties Union had filed a motion for the case to be dismissed on the basis that Jones could not be forced to post a bond making him pay for police protection. An ACLU spokesperson said, "It is unconstitutional to put a price on free speech in anticipation that the speech may not be welcome by others". Robert Sedler, a professor of constitutional law at {w|Wayne State University}, agreed, saying the US Supreme Court has determined that it was unconstitutional to require a bond for police protection.  == Sources ==

[[Australian PM Gillard pressured to address human rights crackdown in China]]The international organisation {w|Human Rights Watch} has called on Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to publicly address China¡¯s recent crackdown on dissidents, during her visit to the country from April 25th to 28th.In an open letter HRW called on Prime Minister Gillard to address the increasing use of repressive force in China. According to HRW at least 39 lawyers and activists have been arrested and between 100 and 200 others have been victims of repressive measures such as house arrest, since February 16th. Prime Minister Gillard is currently on a tour of Asia which included a stop in the disaster hit regions of Japan. She told Australian media before departing that she would "of course be raising human rights." "Our view of course is that we raise human rights. We have a human rights dialogue with China. That dialogue was in session as recently as December last year." HRW¡¯s Asia advocacy director Sophie Richardson said that whilst Prime Minister Gillard has expressed concern in Canberra, "the test is whether she will do so publicly in Beijing"The issue of human rights in China is of particular interest in Australia following the disappearance ¨C and feared arrest ¨C of Australian citizen and pro-democracy activist {w|Yang Hengjun} in China last month. The political blogger and writer disappeared in {w|Guangzhou} in March and although he has since resurfaced, he has not publicly stated exactly what happened during the two day period that he was missing.== Sources ==

[[Sherpa mountaineer Nawang Gombu, first to summit Mount Everest twice, dies]]Gombu was born in Tibet but later moved with his family to a small village in Nepal near Mount Everest.  When he was about 21, Gombu reached the {w|South Col} as the youngest member of {w|Sir Edmund Hilary}'s team in 1953. On that expedition, Hilary and {w|Tenzing Norgay}, Gombu's uncle, were the first to successfully scale {w|Mount Everest}. Gombu set another record as the first person to reach the mountain's summit twice, first in 1963 with {w|Jim Whittaker} on an American expedition and again in 1965 with Captain {w|Avtar Singh Cheema|Awarae Singh Cheema} on an Indian expedition.He scaled many other Himalayan peaks including {w|Makalu}, {w|Nanda Devi} and {w|Cho Oyu}, and is credited with discovering several new mountain routes.Gombu was one of the "Tigers of the Snow", Sherpa mountain climbers who brought recognition to their their ethnic community in the mountains of Tibet and Nepal.He was important in the formation of the {w|Himalayan Mountaineering Institute}, along with other Sherpas. The creation of the Institute was supported by {w|Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru}. Gombu served as Director of Field Training there after Norgay retired from the role, eventually retiring from HMI himself after more than forty years of work for the Institute."He was not only an outstanding climber, Gombu was a fine person who guided Indian mountaineering to a greater height," said {w|Mohan Singh Kohli}, a retired Navy captain and leader of the 1965 Indian  expedition. "Gombu¡¯s death left a big void in the adventure field of the country."For his work, Gombu received many awards, including medals from  Queen Elizabeth II and the {w|National Geographic Society}, and was invited to the {w|White House} by {w|President Kennedy}.== Sources ==

[20:48:32] <dendodge> And that's never going to happen. [20:48:42] <lustre> BarkingFish: more users [20:48:44] <BarkingFish> Shouldn't they be dunking that in favor of writing an encyclopedia? [20:48:46] <pizero> lustre: I did suggest a template to gentle the learning curve.  Just haven't had time to pursue it yet. [20:48:51] <lustre> people like adding more pages to their "created" list [20:49:18] <BarkingFish> lustre: at the expense of accuracy, thinking stuff through, vandalism and general crap which people have to clean up later. [20:49:22] <lustre> WN has less users, therefore more laziness, therefore less interest in cleaning up ugly pages. [20:49:25] <BarkingFish> We do it the other way round, mostly [20:49:40] <lustre> Even on WP, you see areas where it depends on one/two users [20:49:48] <lustre> i.e., copyright cleanup [20:49:51] <MC8> pizero: Amgine's quite anti-template; apparently shiny magic templates kill contribs [20:49:57] <lustre> People hate the menial stuff [20:50:00] <BarkingFish> We start by planning the work, collaborating to write it, checking it, verifying it prior to publication, THEN publishing. [20:50:17] <BarkingFish> Wikipedia is simply : Publish it now, tidy up the cockups later [20:50:27] <dendodge> We generally have articles "owned" by a single person.  What we need to do is work *together* on stories.  Whether that be with newer users, to gently introduce them to the process, or with established editors to produce our best possible stories. [20:50:32] <pizero> This template would be a form for new users to fill out; they'd never see the template end of it. [20:50:36] <lustre> oh yeah, ownership. [20:50:47] <lustre> news articles are "owned" everywhere else. [20:50:58] <MC8> tbh they're owned here too [20:51:00] <lustre> That's why every other site has bylines. We don't. But it operates the same way. [20:51:01] <dendodge> They shouldn't be "owned" here. [20:51:14] <BarkingFish> dendodge: They're not always. [20:51:19] <dendodge> They should be collaborative¡ªthat's the point of a wiki. [20:51:20] <MC8> they shouldn't be in theory. But they are much of the time [20:51:26] <dendodge> BarkingFish: No, they're not always. [20:51:33] <dendodge> But they usually are. [20:51:43] <BarkingFish> Someone starts a story, someone else goes in and cleans up the typos, copyedits the work, maybe adds something new... [20:51:44] <dendodge> Exceptions are both rare and, usually, our best work. [20:52:15] <MC8> BarkingFish: the majority is generally written by the same author though [20:52:21] <lustre> pizero: we need an article wizard [20:52:28] <Badmin> +1 [20:52:30] <MC8> +1 [20:52:33] <lustre> I've said it multiple times and no one helps make one. [20:52:46] * Badmin lacks the ability [20:52:53] <BarkingFish> I lack the concern [20:52:59] <pizero> lustre:  That's kind of what I'm talking about, only I'm going for a low-tech approach. [20:53:16] <BarkingFish> We already have the "start a new story" thing in the newsroom. [20:53:26] <lustre> that's not good for new users, though. [20:53:39] <BarkingFish> It prepages the box with the necessary templates, all they have to do is type the stuff for the story in. [20:53:41] <Badmin> Nobody ever looks at the newsroom, either. It's of limited use imo. [20:53:42] <lustre> An extension would really be good, but I don't trust the devs. [20:53:46] <lustre> I do! [20:53:51] <lustre> I use the newsroom all the time :P [20:53:58] <dendodge> I don't. [20:54:02] <lustre> Do people really ignore it? I didn't realize that. [20:54:06] <dendodge> I haven't visited the newsroom for months. [20:54:07] * Badmin just uses RC  [20:54:08] <pizero> "start a new story" is only a step or two away from what I'm talking about, though. [20:54:12] <lustre> I always have to check to make sure I'm not writing a duplicate. [20:54:16] <BarkingFish> same here [20:54:35] <Badmin> If we had more changes running through, Newsroom might be more useful [20:54:36] <pizero> I check the newsroom mainly for articles mispublished. [20:54:43] <BarkingFish> and I use the start a new story box too, simply because I forget which dang templates to put on if I start one normally [20:55:00] <dendodge> I use the box, yeah ^_^ [20:55:01] <MC8> I generally start with the box on the MP [20:55:02] <lustre> I've never started one manually :P [20:55:13] <dendodge> I use the one on the MP, too :) [20:55:14] <Badmin> Yeah, I use the MP box [20:55:37] <dendodge> [20:55:52] <Badmin> Fascinating though this is, however, we're drfiting more wildly off-course than an Adam Air flight. [20:55:52] <lustre> omg yes [20:56:01] *** MC8 set the channel topic to "Welcome to the Wikinews Workshop! Everyone is welcome to make and discuss suggestions for improving Wikinews here. Please be respectful of others. | This channel is publicly logged. | Improving PR amongst other Wikimedia projects. How do we recruit more users and make ourselves more attractive for prospective contributors?". [20:56:10] <MC8> [20:56:15] <Badmin> Yes, Main Page redesign. That's a better thing to discuss than who uses what box ;) [20:56:17] <dendodge> Oh.  Are we not going to discuss Tina and Amy? [20:56:24] <Badmin> lol  [20:56:27] <pizero> No. [20:56:41] <lustre> tiny > amy [20:56:42] <Badmin> MC8: Breaking the ice, mainly.  [20:56:47] <dendodge> Amy > Tina [20:56:54] <MC8> Badmin: as well as going into public logs [20:56:54] <Badmin> Tina > Amy [20:57:05] <dendodge> :") [20:57:23] <pizero> *is* this being logged, still/yet/again? [20:57:32] <lustre> anywho. [20:57:33] <MC8> yeah, I'll stick it up manually [20:57:33] <dendodge> Yes, it is. [20:57:58] <dendodge> Anyway, back on topic... [20:57:59] <Badmin> Well, yes. Everyone should be able to smile. I see no reason why there can't be occasional humorous exchanges in corporate meetings. Heck, even Parliament. Happier discussions are productive discussions imo. [20:58:07] <BarkingFish> What is happening here is precisely what I raised at the last meeting.  All the indians and no bloody chief. [20:58:21] <lustre> can I ask HOW we fix our issues? [20:58:21] <BarkingFish> Can someone please make sure when we have these meetings that a person takes control of them? [20:58:34] <lustre> Because it just looks impossible due to how WN is structured. [20:58:36] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v BarkingFish [20:58:41] <MC8> there you go [20:58:43] <dendodge> lustre: Does it? [20:58:56] <lustre> as reviews are mandatory [20:59:06] <lustre> and few reviewers review long articles [20:59:09] <dendodge> What we need to do is get our established contributors working together, and with newbies, on collaborative pieces. [20:59:18] <lustre> and long articles are better than short pieces of fluff [20:59:18] <dendodge> And we need to get rid of mandatory peer review. [20:59:22] <BarkingFish> MC8: I meant someone preferably with experience :) [20:59:33] <dendodge> What happened to that doscussion, anyway? [20:59:35] <lustre> dendodge: have fun with that, wasn't that being discussed two months ago? [20:59:36] <MC8> BarkingFish: like? [20:59:37] * Badmin wonders why the review problem prevents addressing all the other problems [20:59:38] <dendodge> It seemed to just die. [20:59:44] <pizero> Long articles are the ones for which collaborative review would be useful. [20:59:48] <lustre> exactly--WN discussions always die. [20:59:54] *** ChanServ sets mode: -v BarkingFish [21:00:01] <BarkingFish> Like the people who ran the first one, Tempo and Amgine. [21:00:17] <BarkingFish> neither of whom appear to be here, but it should be controlled either way [21:00:18] <dendodge> Tempo didn't even turn up... [21:00:25] <BarkingFish> for the first one? [21:00:27] <MC8> heh, that's the hour up [21:00:29] <dendodge> Yag [21:00:30] <BarkingFish> I thought he was there. [21:00:33] <dendodge> No [21:00:34] <-- Badmin has left this channel. [21:00:44] <BarkingFish> +1 [21:00:55] <pizero> Mandatory peer review is what makes us not a blog. [21:01:06] <dendodge> If we write articles that aren't so time-dependent, then publication can take as long as it likes ^_^ [21:01:25] <pizero> Last week's atmosphere was *much* better. [21:01:35] <-- BarkingFish has left this channel. [21:01:36] <lustre> again: why are we using IRC? [21:01:42] <lustre> that's what happens. [21:01:51] <dendodge> Because it allows for real-time discussion. [21:02:01] <lustre> real-time chaos, too. [21:02:24] <lustre> WN->volunteers->not paid->lazy without consequence->not enough quality articles [21:02:39] <pizero> Unfortunately, these workshops have an implicit premise that the existing arrangement must be bad, so bad atmosphere is probably an inevitable trend for them. [21:02:46] <lustre> WN->quality->lots of rules->new users=confused [21:02:58] <lustre> those are the two issues I see. [21:03:17] <lustre> the review process and the complexity. [21:03:25] --> Mattisse has joined this channel. [21:03:26] <lustre> collaboration is not hard, we have etherpad. [21:03:27] <pizero> That's why I proposed to give new users something easier to do than write fully-fledged publication-quality articles. [21:03:45] <lustre> briefs? [21:03:49] <lustre> those died out ages ago. [21:04:18] <pizero> I perked up at etherpad because it sounds great, but haven't had time to investigate it yet. [21:04:57] <pizero> If it's still *another* different interface, that doesn't seem too promising, though. [21:05:02] <MC8> hello, Mattisse [21:05:17] <Mattisse> hello [21:05:35] <pizero> yeah, hi Mattisse.  'Fraid things aren't going as smoothly this week. [21:05:40] <lustre> pizero: it's easy [21:05:49] <lustre> just type and don't delete anyone else's typing :P [21:06:49] --> Tempodivalse has joined this channel. [21:07:01] <MC8> Tempodivalse: you missed the show [21:07:12] <Tempodivalse> Have we started yet ? [21:07:18] * MC8 blinks [21:07:18] <pizero> Is it possible that IRC moves *too* fast, and we'd do better running these biweekly workshops on-wiki? [21:07:38] <pizero> Isn't that the punchline of a joke? [21:08:00] <MC8> Tempodivalse: it started an hour ago [21:08:09] <pizero> "Ready when you are, C.B.", or something like that. [21:08:15] <Tempodivalse> Really? I must have my time zones mixed up [21:08:23] <Tempodivalse> I don't see the log bot in here, are we on air? [21:08:26] <MC8> yes [21:08:32] <pizero> Somehow or other. [21:08:41] <Mattisse> This is not the topic. Just curious. Why is the main page being redesigned? [21:08:42] <Tempodivalse> Well, a rather disappointing showing .. hardly a quorum [21:08:52] <MC8> Well, you didn't turn up... [21:09:28] <Tempodivalse> !time [21:09:29]  Tempodivalse: UTC: 21:09:29 - San Francisco: 14:09 - New York: 17:09 - London: 22:09 - Brussels: 23:09 - Moscow: 01:09 - New Delhi: 02:39 - Hong Kong: 05:09 - Tokyo: 06:09 - Sydney: 07:09 - Auckland: 09:09 [21:09:56] <MC8> Mattisse: because it's old [21:10:13] <lustre> Mattisse: look at any other news site [21:10:16] <lustre> look at wikinews [21:10:18] <lustre> uggggleeeee. [21:10:21] <Tempodivalse> !time UTC [21:10:22]  Tempodivalse: UTC: 21:10 [21:10:26] <Tempodivalse> mc8: wrong [21:10:36] <Tempodivalse> it's started just ten minutes ago [21:10:54] <Tempodivalse> Remember that the UK is no longer on UTC, but an hour ahead ... [21:11:06] <MC8> "Next meeting at April 24 at 20:00 UTC." [21:11:18] <dendodge> Mattisse: Our main page has been in place for some time, and is ugly and out-of-date compared to other news sites. [21:11:26] <dendodge> We just need a change, is all :) [21:11:47] <pizero> It's not *that* bad.  I'm not opposed to some improvements. [21:11:56] <lustre> it's too ... short [21:11:56] <Tempodivalse> MC8, just because i'm not here, shouldn't mean the workshop can't take place [21:12:08] <Tempodivalse> fetchcomms, actually, i think shorter is better [21:12:16] <lustre> why? [21:12:21] <lustre> it shows we have little content to showcase. [21:12:22] <Tempodivalse> I'm a minimalist. [21:12:24] <lustre> :P [21:12:31] <Tempodivalse> We *do* have only a little content to showcase. [21:12:37] <Tempodivalse> That's the point. [21:12:41] <pizero> It has been taking place, though the atmosphere drove off one person. [21:12:42] <lustre> yes, but we have to disguise that. [21:12:51] <dendodge> Tempodivalse: Have you seen my design?  It's only marginally different to the current one, ATM. [21:12:54] <Mattisse> agree on minimalist [21:12:58] <lustre> People don't want to read a news source that has little news. [21:13:11] <Tempodivalse> Well, then they won't come to WN ... [21:13:15] <dendodge> But we'll have no way to fill all the boxes you want, lustre. [21:13:26] <dendodge> There just aren't enough recent stories. [21:13:40] <Tempodivalse> Content has got to come first, imo [21:13:44] <lustre> what do you mean, dendodge? [21:13:59] <pizero> Remember when someone posted on the cooler that they always read Wikinews first, because it's the most neutral site around? [21:13:59] <lustre> Tempodivalse: but we need to expand our reader base--and through that, our writer base. [21:14:13] <Tempodivalse> we can have the most beautiful ever front page but it's useless if there's no stories to go around [21:14:14] <lustre> that's half good. [21:14:25] <lustre> Tempodivalse, yes, but we can have both [21:14:28] <dendodge> lustre: We don't have enough news to fill the various boxes on your design. [21:14:38] <lustre> you mean the country boxes, or the leads? [21:14:45] <dendodge> The country boxes. [21:14:53] <lustre> hmm [21:14:54] <dendodge> There's never any news for Oceania. [21:14:59] <lustre> that's true. [21:15:04] <dendodge> Ever.  Not any more, since all our Ozzies left. [21:15:11] <lustre> well, somwhat [21:15:21] <pizero> We've had several Australia stories just recently. [21:15:33] <Mattisse> why did the ozzies leave? [21:15:34] <dendodge> That's because of our journalism students, though, isn't it? [21:15:43] <Tempodivalse> more stories = more readers = more contributors. It's that simple, really [21:15:58] <dendodge> That was years ago.  They just left.  They used to be really active, and interest just faded. [21:16:03] <dendodge> I'm not sure why. [21:16:16] <lustre> hmm [21:16:19] <Mattisse> why is an important question [21:16:29] <lustre> dendodge, what about using topic boxes vs region ones? [21:16:41] <lustre> We should at least be able to have a good number of stories to feature that way. [21:16:46] <dendodge> I still don't think we could fill them. [21:16:58] <dendodge> We usually have less than 20 stories in a week. [21:17:08] <lustre> I wish there was a way we could rotate the more popular ones [21:17:15] <lustre> but DPL isn't that smart, I don't think. [21:17:26] <Mattisse> newbies should be treated better [21:17:31] <lustre> i.e., the top two or three categories each week [21:17:32] <Tempodivalse> Well, trying to disguise that we have a low output isn't the way to go, imo [21:17:42] <lustre> Mattisse, yes, and making an article should be easier. [21:17:51] <Tempodivalse> ^ and that [21:17:52] <dendodge> We need to be honest, and say, "We're small, but we're friendly.  Come and join in!" [21:18:08] --> diegogrez has joined this channel. [21:18:12] <lustre> Tempodivalse: what can we do, though? news is visual--people won't read if they aren't used to the format. [21:18:14] <Tempodivalse> Just make sure you live up to that [21:18:14] <dendodge> Of course, friendly is an issue we need to work on :P [21:18:33] <Tempodivalse> lustre: Write more stories. [21:18:38] <pizero> Both of which - treating newbies better and making an article easier - are addressed by the "story form" concept. [21:18:44] <lustre> Tempodivalse: i know [21:18:51] <lustre> but I mean, why a wiki as a news platform? [21:18:55] <lustre> it's weird. [21:18:55] <Mattisse> but when a newbie writes a story and the reviewer fails, saying "read the style guide", that's not friendly or informative [21:19:02] <dendodge> So we can collaborate on news stories. [21:19:04] <lustre> Mattisse: that's the laziness issue [21:19:09] <lustre> which is why no one reviews long articles [21:19:21] <lustre> spam> Tornadoes damage hundreds of Missouri homes, force closure of airport [21:19:23] <lustre> review that. [21:19:25] <lustre> :P [21:19:42] <dendodge> What we need is for established editors to join in and help newbies with their articles. [21:19:54] <lustre> laziness--no incentive [21:19:57] <Mattisse> for example, do you ever post on the newbie's page, notifying them that their article failed and why? [21:20:06] <lustre> also ownership, i sense people are afraid to "take over" an article. [21:20:06] <pizero> Mattisse: using a story form would avoid failing newbies articles on most SG issues. [21:20:07] <dendodge> Rather than just failing it, they should sit down and fix it, and try to guide the user through the process by example. [21:20:29] <pizero> The story form would *also* bring together newbies and experienced Wikinewsies. [21:20:34] <Mattisse> yes, I agree dendodge [21:20:36] <Tempodivalse> dendodge: exactly [21:20:37] <lustre> dendodge, exactly, although they would feel it's wasted if the noob never edits again [21:20:57] <lustre> can we name some non-MSM sources that ARE successful, and analyze why? [21:21:03] <lustre> like newser [21:21:23] <Mattisse> There is almost zero personal interaction with a newbie who has submitted an article.  [21:21:49] <lustre> then again, newbies don't interact back. [21:22:05] <lustre> they expect their writing to be perfect and don't check to see if the review passed--sometimes, at least. [21:22:06] <MC8> ok, the first hour is up at http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Wikinews:IRC_workshop/April_24,_2011&action=purge [21:22:27] <Mattisse> suppose a newbie writes an article but doesn't know about the Newsroom? [21:22:51] <pizero> And not checking back would *also* be partly remedied by a "story form". [21:22:59] <dendodge> MC8: Hey, why am I pink? [21:23:07] <MC8> dendodge: I thought you suited it [21:23:07] * pizero does realize xe's talking to xyrself. [21:23:16] <lustre> no. [21:23:24] <lustre> i'm half listening :P [21:23:27] <MC8> pizero: I was reading, couldn't think of anything to say back [21:23:48] <pizero> MC8: Oh. [21:23:50] <lustre> by story form, you mean a wizard thing? [21:23:58] <lustre> or a "form of story"?> [21:24:14] <pizero> A form, with some boxes to fill out... [21:24:28] <pizero> Probably short boxes for each of the basic questions, [21:24:43] <pizero> for maybe up to four sources, [21:24:56] <lustre> yeah [21:25:11] <pizero> and maybe a few further details. [21:25:15] <lustre> we need that, but are we going to get it? no. because no one is going to figure out how to put it together. [21:25:18] <lustre> that's WN for ya. [21:25:20] <lustre> :P [21:25:26] <Mattisse> aren't there ways a person could start contributing gradually, like at the other wiki sites, without starting off by writing a full article? [21:25:33] <-- diegogrez has left this channel. [21:25:52] <lustre> tempo, look at http://www.newser.com/user-grid.html [21:26:07] <lustre> they get 3-5 user stories/day [21:26:25] <lustre> we get around the same, I think. [21:26:27] <pizero> Mattisse:  I don't think so, other than many months of copyediting. [21:26:40] <pizero> So I figured that should be fixed. [21:26:41] <lustre> yet we just somehow seem more pitiful [21:26:53] <Tempodivalse> hmm [21:26:56] <lustre> Mattisse: WN is boring :P [21:27:08] <lustre> copyedit or write an article or say random things at talk pages [21:27:41] * MC8 edits for the community. the community is awesome. [21:28:16] <lustre> another thing: [21:28:22] <lustre> users write random stories about everything [21:28:46] <lustre> so a) no user focuses on a specific area and b) we don't cover the BIG HEADLINES. [21:29:07] <MC8> you can't force users to make certain articles [21:29:11] <lustre> I know [21:29:14] <pizero> Nor should we. [21:29:22] <lustre> but that's one problem. [21:29:33] <lustre> and how do we solve it other than getting more users? [21:29:50] <Mattisse> i gave up on the big headlines because after I wrote it I would find someone else already had [21:30:01] <pizero> We do get more users.  But [21:30:27] <pizero> it *can't* happen overnight, and if we tried to make it happen overnight we'd just wreck the things we do have going for us. [21:30:42] <pizero> So we keep whittling away at the problems. [21:30:53] <pizero> I'll tackle the "story form" this week. [21:30:58] <Mattisse> why did users leave here? what happened? [21:31:07] <lustre> people thought it was getting off topic [21:31:33] <pizero> Mattisse may be talking about the Great Exodus of 2010. [21:31:40] <lustre> oohh. [21:32:00] <lustre> let's not talk about that >.> [21:32:02] <Mattisse> what was that? [21:32:06] <Tempodivalse> ugh [21:32:06] <lustre> other than it was a dark time in WN history. [21:32:17] <dendodge> There was lots of drama, and a few users resigned over it. [21:32:21] <Tempodivalse> More than a few [21:32:26] <pizero> Let's not spend the *workshop* talking about it. [21:32:34] <Mattisse> it's referred all the time, but I don't know what happened [21:32:53] <Tempodivalse> mattise, it's a long story [21:33:09] <dendodge> The crux of it was the Matthewedwards fiasco.  Search the WN:AAA archives for that name. [21:33:29] <lustre> Mattisse: basically some shit went down and people were hella rude. [21:33:31] <dendodge> We do need to avoid drama. [21:33:38] <Tempodivalse> There were other facets that were nearly as bad too [21:33:40] <lustre> and then it was all a misunderstanding and people got mad. [21:33:41] <pizero> Note that Matthewedwards xyrself stayed, and became a reviewer. [21:33:55] <lustre> largely inactive, now, though. [21:33:56] <dendodge> Just when things get working quite well, we have a massive argument and everything breaks. [21:34:10] <Tempodivalse> I know. The community hurts itself. [21:34:11] <dendodge> It happens every so often in WN history. [21:34:26] <pizero> There were issues of not assuming bad faith, though, and whether or not to assume good faith, and reviewing standards. [21:34:28] <Tempodivalse> 98% of the drama we have can be very very easily avoided by not being so brusque [21:34:32] <dendodge> It usually involves an established editor and a newbie pissing each other off. [21:34:51] <lustre> >_> [21:35:01] <lustre> anywho [21:35:15] <lustre> the problem with WN is that it's all volunteers, and it's a hobby. [21:35:37] <lustre> you can't run a major news site on hobbies without a massive number of volunteers, like WP has. [21:35:41] <pizero> I've got some ideas about replacing AGI, but I've hesitated to put them on-wiki until they're ready...  [21:35:54] <lustre> and you can't get volunteers without making it nice for them. [21:35:59] <lustre> like yahoo answers. [21:36:00] <Mattisse> but is nothing is ever discussed, then how does a newbie find out anything? Like me. I feel like I don't know what's going on here. [21:36:14] <lustre> everything is dumbed down for the computer-illiterate. [21:36:23] <lustre> Mattisse: WN needs a much better help structure, yes [21:36:37] <lustre> and Mattisse you don't WANT to know about the Great Exodus thinger [21:36:43] <pizero> Wikis run on *idealism*.  Our idealistic vision is free, neutral, reliable citizen journalism. [21:37:07] <Mattisse> but all the wikipedia sister projects are all volunteers [21:37:14] <Tempodivalse> Well, i think the first priority is to foster a caring, encouraging environment for others [21:37:48] <Mattisse> why do "established" editors hardly ever write articles? [21:37:55] <Tempodivalse> For instance, in the last few weeks I had serious thoughts of just quitting again and giving up. [21:38:28] <dendodge> Mattisse: Some of us are just too busy, while others prefer working on long-term projects. [21:38:39] <Tempodivalse> Everything seems, well, futile. I hate to be pessimistic, but from personal observations a lot of other users feel the same way [21:38:47] <pizero> Tempo: Yeah.  And do it *without* compromising the idealistic vision.  Believing one can do both is itself idealistic.  And it's why I'm passionate about Wikinews. [21:38:48] <MC8> right, I've logged up to 2130UTC, could someone do the rest? [21:39:07] <lustre> Mattisse: you wonder why Wikiquote is horribly in need to cleanup, Wikiversity has major internal issues, and Wikibooks is less-than-half-baked? [21:39:11] <dendodge> I've pretty much given up on writing for WN, since it's a lot of effort, and nobody will ever read it. [21:39:15] <lustre> wikisource is half decent. [21:39:17] <Tempodivalse> dendodge: same here [21:39:41] <dendodge> And I'm so busy IRL¡ªsince I started college, I haven't had time for WN. [21:39:42] <Mattisse> wikisource has a very pleasant atmosphere [21:40:03] <lustre> dendodge: you stupid brits, getting into college at 16 or 17 [21:40:16] <dendodge> So between college and personal issues, I'm kept too busy to write articles. [21:40:16] <lustre> Mattisse: that's because there's nothing to bicker over. [21:40:36] <lustre> personal--girl/boyfriend giving you issues? ;) [21:40:53] <Mattisse> what is there to bicker about here? [21:41:16] <MC8> lustre: college != university [21:41:24] <dendodge> lustre: I don't really want to say in a publicly logged channel :P [21:41:45] <pizero> Wikinews is *exciting*.  Because finding a way to reconcile higher quality demands with wiki-hood is the future of all the projects, and here we're on the front lines of that. [21:41:48] <Mattisse> if editors here don't feel they have the time to write articles, how can you expect a newbie to? [21:41:59] <lustre> MC8: oh lol [21:41:59] <-- dendodge has left this server. [21:42:13] <Tempodivalse> I don't really find wikinews exciting any more [21:42:18] <lustre> dendodge has a girl/boyfriend? o_O [21:42:35] <MC8> lustre: he wishes [21:42:39] --> dendodge has joined this channel. [21:43:22] <dendodge> Oops.  I sorta clicked the wrong button :P [21:43:31] <lustre> hah. [21:43:36] <lustre> [16:42] lustre dendodge has a girl/boyfriend? [21:43:38] <lustre> [16:42] MC8 lustre: he wishes [21:43:42] <lustre> Tempodivalse: doeds anyone [21:43:45] <lustre> does* [21:43:48] <Mattisse> why don't editors join to cover a particular area? Like on wikipedia - all the editors from India? [21:44:04] <lustre> really, I only write stuff that's interesting to me. [21:44:05] <dendodge> Hey, I said I didn't want it discussed in a publicly logged channel! [21:44:16] <lustre> Mattisse: Nascar1996, for example? [21:44:21] <MC8> Mattisse: I like the idea of a workforce, but the problem is getting them there [21:44:26] <lustre> not enough users. [21:44:27] <Mattisse> but that's true of all the wikis [21:44:30] <lustre> depressing to write on your own [21:45:22] <Mattisse> yes, like Nascar 1996 [21:46:22] <Mattisse> people from Australia covering Australia, etc.  [21:47:46] <pizero> When I've written, I've looked for a story I wanted to share with Wikinews readers 'cause they might not have heard of it.  If that happens to be stories on one topic, fine, but maybe it isn't. [21:48:18] <pizero> Never gonna get the big stories, that way. [21:48:21] <Mattisse> there was an editor who said he was from china. He wrote an article that sat for days. I finally rewrote it and it was publish but by that time he was gone. [21:48:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o MC8 [21:48:49] *** MC8 sets mode: +F [21:48:50] *** MC8 sets mode: -o MC8 [21:48:55] <lustre> . [21:48:59] <lustre> remind me what F is. [21:49:11] <MC8> allow forward [21:49:48] <pizero> A "story form" might also get established editors more into the habit of editing newbies' articles, and that *might* spill over into the non-form ones too. [21:50:20] <pizero> [21:50:51] <lustre> no. [21:51:06] <Mattisse> but if no one here is willing to write article, why should a newbie? [21:51:14] <MC8> pizero: I like the idea of a story wizard, not sure how one could implement it [21:51:35] * MC8 secretly enjoys metaspace more than mainspace [21:52:08] <dendodge> Mattisse: I'm willing.  I just don't have time. [21:53:11] <Mattisse> there is something wrong that I don't know about. [21:53:11] <lustre> Tornadoes damage hundreds of Missouri homes, force closure of airport [21:53:15] <lustre> SOMEONE REVIEW THTA. [21:53:17] <lustre> THAT*. [21:53:53] <Mattisse> reviewers don't review [21:54:23] <Mattisse> the Tornadoes damage article is very good and it is well sourced [21:55:54] <MC8> lustre: American Airlines needs local linking and/or added as a cat [21:56:14] <pizero> Mattisse, one piece of the puzzle you *might* be missing is how big a task peer-reviewing an article actually is.  Everything on all sides kind of revolves around that. [21:56:38] <Mattisse> Some one is finally writing Renowned Indian guru ?ri Satya Sai Baba, dies aged 84 ¡þ [21:56:40] <Mattisse> I have been looking at that for days. [21:56:51] <gopher65> crap. Forgot about this thing:P [21:57:11] <gopher65> Lustre: I'm reviewing that now. [21:57:20] <lustre> yay thankssss [21:57:24] <gopher65> Is anyone else reviewing it? If they are, I'll stop, since I just started. [21:57:26] <Mattisse> But reviewing an FAC or GAN is a big job too, bigger than reviewing an article here. [21:57:42] <lustre> gopher65: don't think so, mikemoral said he would later if no one else did [21:57:48] <gopher65> k [22:01:28] <pizero> Mattisse: I expect the whole relentless-news-deadlines thing makes a profound difference. [22:02:06] <Mattisse> but wasn't this site successful once? [22:02:27] <lustre> yeah [22:02:37] <lustre> last year we had tons of articles published each day [22:02:40] <Mattisse> why? [22:02:50] <lustre> there was a writing contest--lots of stuff [22:02:57] <lustre> then users just dropped off the radar [22:03:02] <pizero> More people, I'd say. [22:03:06] <lustre> interest declined. [22:03:20] <pizero> morale declined. [22:03:37] <pizero> spiraled downward, actually. [22:03:56] <Mattisse> why? [22:04:26] <pizero> bad morale creates more bad morale. [22:04:42] <Mattisse> most places on the web people are wanting to publish [22:05:11] <lustre> idk. [22:05:21] <lustre> this whole irc is depressing me [22:05:39] <Mattisse> me too [22:05:40] <pizero> this workshop has been super-depressing. [22:06:01] <pizero> ...which is a morale problem. :-) [22:06:45] <lustre> Mattisse: are you a reviewer yet? [22:06:48] <lustre> if not, become one [22:06:54] <lustre> we need active peeps like you [22:07:03] <lustre> before you become disillusioned and leave [22:07:05] <lustre> :D [22:07:30] <gopher65> Well, more probably do what I do [22:07:32] <-- dendodge has left this channel. [22:07:44] <Mattisse> Well, I was turned down. Then I was nominated for check user. So I don't think I want to become one. [22:07:53] <gopher65> Periodically have a week of activity, then stop for a month or two, then have a week of activity. It's a good way to avoid burnout:) [22:07:59] <gopher65> And you don't get bored that way [22:08:13] <Tempodivalse> well, personally i think this site isn't going to be a success unless it radically changes its editing environment [22:08:25] <Tempodivalse> the status quo is not working. that should be painfully obvious by now [22:08:30] <pizero> Burnout *is* a hazard, with a site this intense. [22:08:33] <gopher65> If everyone did that, we'd have a more steady flow of articles, with two or three people a week writing/reviewing articles, instead of the current bursts of activity [22:08:41] <lustre> pizero: make the WMF pay us? :P [22:08:46] <lustre> we need /incentive/ [22:09:10] <Tempodivalse> A few days ago I seriously considered quitting. Sometimes I think I still will ... [22:09:22] <Mattisse> how come people are willing to make hundreds of edits a day on wikipedia for years? [22:09:22] <Tempodivalse> anyways ... too depressing :b [22:09:34] <Tempodivalse> WP is more interesting, probably, and more rewarding [22:09:39] <Tempodivalse> to them [22:09:42] <pizero> idealism is the incentive.  That, and getting one's high-quality articles published. [22:09:52] <Tempodivalse> idealism isn't realism [22:10:09] <pizero> No, it's not, and that's why it motivates volunteers. [22:10:31] <pizero> I've experienced this on multiple projects. [22:10:50] <pizero> You look into it, discover they're trying to do something impractical, [22:11:22] <pizero> and think, "wow, these folks are really idealistists; how can I be a part of that?" [22:11:37] <Mattisse> I sill don't understand why there aren't more Nascar types. This is an ideal forum for someone that wants news covered on a particular topic  [22:12:21] <Mattisse> look at wikisource. why isn't there burnout there? [22:12:37] <pizero> No news deadlines. [22:13:24] <lustre> also, proofreading is easy. [22:13:38] <pizero> As an alternative to Tempo's sense that things have to change really radically, I think lots of things are somewhat out of whack, and it all adds up. [22:13:40] <Mattisse> the deadlines are a problem. the two to three day thing. it means you have to wait until a topic has been out a few days and try to judge when it is going to go stale. [22:13:52] <Tempodivalse> A project is only as stressful as you think it should be [22:13:56] <lustre> WP gets more eyes than WN [22:14:01] <Tempodivalse> We don't have to have stress if we don't want to. [22:14:08] <pizero> Late review has been proposed, repeatedly. [22:14:09] <lustre> if you think people will appreciate your work more = incentive [22:14:16] <Mattisse> proofreading is the way newbie get into projects [22:14:27] <lustre> b/c it's easy [22:15:32] <Mattisse> wikisource is harder than here, as it is so relentless technical.  [22:15:41] <gopher65> Man Fetchcommons:). You really scoured those articles for info [22:15:42] <gopher65> Heh [22:15:46] <lustre> hehe. [22:15:54] <pizero> proofreading is how I got into this project; but there isn't enough scope for it to support the number of new contributors we need to train up. [22:16:05] <gopher65> I like how you put two and two together to come up with some interesting stats, like the "30000 homes still affected out of 47000". Good job. [22:16:26] <lustre> it speaks volumes about how much a life i have on a saturday night. [22:16:27] <gopher65> errr, residents, not homes [22:16:28] <lustre> :P [22:17:02] <MC8> saturday night I feel the air is getting hot [22:17:15] <Mattisse> the Tornadoes article is really good. I tried to save it but thankfully Fetchcommons took over. [22:17:24] * MC8 throws that in to make log licensing complicated [22:17:52] <pizero> Mattisse: "Hard" does not necessarily imply the sort of time-oriented intensity we have here. [22:18:56] <Mattisse> well, if the stress level doesn't work here, then maybe the timeframe thing should be modified [22:19:14] <pizero> Late review again.  Each time it's brought up, [22:19:27] <pizero> Brian McNeil opposes it. [22:19:37] <pizero> Not without a rational reason. [22:20:08] <pizero> His reasoning, as I understand it, is that if you make significant changes after the "freshness horizon", [22:20:17] <Mattisse> a couple of days ago, about six article went stale in one day. No one had reviewed any for several days. [22:20:53] <pizero> ... you can't be neutral because you know what happened, and you're sliding into encyclopedia territory. [22:20:59] <Mattisse> But "real" news sites do it all the time. [22:21:21] --> Wackywace has joined this channel. [22:21:26] <lustre> oh yes [22:21:26] <Mattisse> But the first info out is often wrong. [22:21:31] <lustre> We NNEEEEED an udpate system [22:21:42] <lustre> it can be as easy  as renaming to "UPDATE: [title]" [22:22:13] <pizero> Update is good too, but we can already do that, sort of, can't we? [22:22:21] <Mattisse> sometimes just after an article is published, the news actually gets covered but TOO LATE [22:22:41] <pizero> Late review is about not slapping down newbies because they didn't get the article in shape fast enough. [22:23:16] <Mattisse> you can just slap UPDATE on an article? [22:23:28] <pizero> Not exactly, no. [22:23:37] <pizero> You can write a new article. [22:23:44] <gopher65> You can just update the article directly, as long as it has been less than 24 hours since publication [22:24:11] <gopher65> If it has been longer than that, then it probably warrents a new article in any case. The new article can, however, reuse much of the background material from the old article [22:24:23] <lustre> except then people have to re-review that old stuff [22:24:29] <gopher65> And since it is using material from a Wikinews article, it can be just cut and paste [22:24:35] <gopher65> Yeah, there is that problem. [22:25:01] <pizero> If the new story is too different, you may want to make it a separate article even within 24 hours. [22:25:08] <Mattisse> the first news out is usually wire info and copyies of wire info. Then after you write the article, interesting stuff gets published. [22:25:20] <gopher65> What I'd like to see is some stuff on the talk page saying soething like: "only the first 2 paragraphs are new, everything else was copied from the previously reviewed wikinews article".  [22:25:27] <gopher65> That way we know what to review  [22:25:59] <Mattisse> yes, why is there no "collaboration" on the collaboration page? [22:25:59] <gopher65> CNN does that kind of crap all the time:P [22:26:11] <pizero> There can be. [22:26:27] <pizero> [22:26:36] <lustre> doesn't have to be :P [22:26:45] <lustre> unless MC8 is still puttering away. [22:26:47]  Except last time a breaking article was updated - the sub shooting one - the whole article was essentially "two people were injured; no-one arrested" before an update was slapped on the end without updating theorist of the article saying essentially "one was killed and a sailor has been arrested". It's just embarrassing. [22:26:50] <Mattisse> they all do it - the Guardian, Los Angeles Times etc. [22:27:08] <-- Tempodivalse has left this server. [22:27:09] * MC8 is logging, but I'm not planning to add pretty colours again [22:27:14] <lustre> hm. [22:27:24] <lustre> why can't we just buy the AP crap, free or not. [22:27:29] <lustre> then we actually have /stories/ [22:27:31] <lustre> :P [22:27:48] <lustre> or like the serbian WN [22:27:55] <gopher65> SR wikinews sucks though:P [22:27:59] <pizero> Mattisse: That doesn't keep us from aspiring to better. [22:28:00] <lustre> they have the CC licensing agreement with the beta site [22:28:13] <gopher65> Then we'd just be a mirror site, and I don't see the point to that [22:28:17] <lustre> meh [22:28:17]  Didn't someone ask the WMF about buying wire articles a while back? [22:28:20] <lustre> true [22:28:27] <gopher65> Then the 'pedians saying "why does wikinews even exist?" would have a real point. [22:28:34] <lustre> Wackywace, if they did, there was shit about non-free content. [22:28:50] <gopher65> Because I sure as heck wonder why serbian wikinews exists, since it is just a bot run mirror site. [22:29:06] <Mattisse> I agree. there is too much wire stuff in the news as it is. no point in adding more. [22:30:16] <Mattisse> much of writing an article is figuring out how to reconcile conflicting sources, as the breaking news inevitably is inaccurate. [22:30:38] <MC8> gopher65: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects I dare you [22:30:56] <lustre> please do [22:31:07] <lustre> we can watch Brian protest [22:31:12] <lustre> ;) [22:31:28] <pizero> ...much of it is, if one already knows some other things that we know but most newbies don't.

[22:42:22] <MC8> I'll paste the lot again
[[Renowned Indian guru ?r¨© Satya Sai Baba dies aged 84]]?r¨© Satya Sai Baba, one of India's most prominent spiritual leaders and revered by millions of followers worldwide, died Sunday in a {w|Puttaparthi} hospital, following a {w|cardiac arrest}. He was 84 and had been in hospital since last month, suffering from kidney failure and respiratory problems.Followers and devotees of ?r¨© Baba considered him to be the manifestation of a "living God" on Earth and believed he had powers of magic, such as being able to pull things from out of thin air.Former Indian Prime Minister {w|Atal Bihari Vajpayee} was one of ?r¨© Baba's followers, as was international test cricketer {w|Sachin Tendulkar}.Worshippers carried Baba's image through the streets of Bangalore and extra police were deployed in his hometown of {w|Puttaparthi}. In Delhi, masses gathered in temples and some refused to accept Baba's death.With an estimated six million followers, Baba saw donations allow for the expansion of his home village to include many temples, a hospital offering free medical care, a university, and an airport. His first permanent facility opened 60 years ago.Born Sathyanarayana Raju, Baba decided at the age of fourteen that he was the reincarnation of 19th-century guru {w|Sai Baba of Shirdi}. The legend runs that Baba was stung by a scorpion and then sang religious chants in a language previously unknown to him. He predicted his death in 2019, as well as a third and final reincarnation in Karnataka state in 2023.Nobody has been appointed to take over running the trust that promotes the faith, which has over 1,200 centres worldwide. There are fears the family and trust could argue, leading to a government takeover. "If the government has to take over the affairs of Sai Baba's mission that could spell its end," warned one devotee."Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba," said Baba in 2000, after allegations of sexual abuse were made against him by young men, claims the BBC highlighted in 2004. "I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day," Baba added. Claims that ?r¨© Baba was a charlatan and allegations of sexual abuse dogged him constantly.  In 1993, six people "died violently in the spiritual leader's private rooms," The Guardian reported. No full explanation has ever been given for the deaths, though speculation of a money dispute has been raised.In a statement, current Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the death of the guru was an ""irreparable loss" to India, adding, "He was a spiritual leader who inspired millions to lead a moral and meaningful life even as they followed the religion of their choice."The guru's body is being kept at the hospital amid appeals for his devotees not to flood them to see his body. The public viewing of ?r¨© Baba's body will take place Monday and Tuesday, and a funeral will follow. There are to be four days of mourning in his home state, Andhra Pradesh, by decree of the state government.== Sources ==

[[Dingoes attack toddler on Fraser Island]]A three-year-old girl has been bitten by two {w|dingoes} while holidaying with her parents on {w|Fraser Island}, Queensland, Australia. The two animals responsible for the attack have since been captured and {w|euthanised} by wildlife rangers.The child was on the beach with her parents while they waited to be transported to the mainland on the {w|Hook Point} barge. Witnesses report that the child wandered into nearby sand dunes where she was repeatedly bitten on the legs by the wild dogs. Members of the Fraser Island Preservation group believe that the parents are to blame for the attack. Spokeswoman Bree Jashin has stated the attack was the result of inattentiveness. ¡°The child was unsupervised and you have to ask how could a three-year-old get so close to the dingoes?¡± Experts such as Environmental Department manager Terry Harper say the attack is uncharacteristic for the dingoes on Fraser Island which is said to be one of the last remaining safe havens for purebred dingoes. "This is a very timely reminder for everybody about how important it is to stay very close to your children on Fraser Island," Harper stated. "Adults should always stay very close to their children. We know that they do excite dingoes."The child received medical attention at the site of the attack and was then transported to Gympie Hospital.== Sources == 
[[BP]]I'd be careful with using a Nazi analogy because it may just reinforce my point that these problems are exacerbated by countries such as the US, UK and France. The cruel punishments enforced against Germany arguably nutured conditions under which Naziism could breed - I could equally say that the foreign policy of the US and UK are doing the same for muslim fundamentalism.Nobody is attempting to be an apologiser for the terrible things that have been committed under the name of Islam. But what is your solution? If we were to assume that all of Islam was dangerous to western perception of how a life should be lead, what should we do about it? Kill every single muslim in the world? good fucking luck, we can't stabilise one country in a decade its not going to be possible to exterminate half the planets population. I think you need to realise that most people dont fly planes in to buildings or blow themselves up - muslim, christian or otherwise. But the approach of the US - be democratic and like us or else is not helping matters.
[[U.S. President Barack Obama releases original birth certificate]]The {w|White House} today released a detailed Hawaii birth certificate in an attempt to put to rest the issue of President Barack Obama's legitimacy to hold the office of president. Shortly after the unexpected release, the president spoke live on national television, explaining, "We do not have time for this kind of silliness."  President Obama noted that the issue of his birthplace began during his campaign. "I have watched with bemusement, I've been puzzled at the degree at which this thing just kept on going," he said, and blamed media culture for perpetuating the controversy. The president did not answer reporters' questions nor explain why the document was not released until now."We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers," he said, noting the severe problems the nation faces and the importance of the decisions that need to be made. Obama said the problems could not be resolved "if we are distracted."The {w|U.S. Constitution} states that only  a "{w|Natural Born Citizen Clause|natural born}" citizen of the country can become president. Some have contended that Obama was born overseas and is thus disqualified from holding the office. Although a recent poll by  {w|CNN}/{w|Opinion Research Corporation} poll showed that most Americans believe Obama was "definitely or probably born in the United States", according to CNN, 40 percent of {w|Republican Party|Republican}s doubted Obama is a natural born citizen eligible to be president. The newly released document, signed by the obstetrician and Obama's mother, shows that Obama was born in {w|Honolulu} on August 4, 1961 of a Caucasian mother born in Kansas and and an African father born in Kenya. It was signed on August 7 and 8.Prominent businessman {w|Donald Trump} has been highlighting the question of Obama's birthplace recently as he mulled over whether to run for the presidency himself, and took credit for its release today. "He should have done it a long time ago," he told journalists. "I am really honored to play such a big role in hopefully, hopefully getting rid of this issue." == Sources ==

[[Afghan pilot kills nine Americans]]Eight American troops and one contractor were shot and killed by an Afghan {w|Afghan National Army Air Force|National Army Air Force} pilot Wednesday. Five Afghan soldiers were also wounded in the attack, for which the Taliban has claimed responsibility.The incident, which began around 10 a.m. Afghan time, occurred in the operations room of the Afghan Air Force in {w|Kabul International Airport}. The shooter, Ahmad Gul Sahebi, was killed by NATO forces."Suddenly, in the middle of the meeting, shooting started," said Afghan Air Corps spokesman Colonel Bahader. "After the shooting started, we saw a number of Afghan army officers and soldiers running out of the building. Some were even throwing themselves out of the windows to get away."The shooter's brother, Hassan Sahebi, said, "My brother was a little depressed recently, but he had served with Afghanistan's national army for 20 years. He loved his country and his people. He was a good man." He also said that his brother was facing financial troubles, but was not connected with the Taliban. A spokesman for the militia group, however, described Ahmad Gul Sahebi as an informant and sleeper agent who began planning the shooting five months ago.Afghan President Hamid Karzai quickly condemned the attack and offered condolence to the victims and their families. He also said that the police and military would investigate the matter. Wednesday's incident is the seventh this year in which NATO or Afghan forces have been killed by rogue Afghan troops or insurgents dressed as troops. == Sources == 
[[US Federal Reserve Chairman gives first news conference]]On Wednesday, at the first live public news conference  ever  given by the {w|Federal Reserve}, Federal Reserve Chairman {w|Ben S. Bernanke}  explained  the {w|central bank|US central bank's} recent policy  to a small group of reporters and answered some questions.The conference was conducted two hours after the release of a report by the Fed's policymaking  committee, the {w|Federal Open Market Committee} outlining its policies decided the day before. Until 1994 the Fed  gave no information about the  policy decisions made in its meetings pertaining to  {w|Federal funds rate|short-term interest rates} and other policies. The public was left to guess what decisions were. In 1994 the Fed began issuing brief reports. Unlike the US, the central banks in Europe, Japan, Canada and other countries have regularly meetings with the press after making such  policy decisions. The public has increasingly been aware of the secretive practices of the Fed, especially after its unprecedented intervention with massive bailouts of large financial institutions during the recent financial crises.  At Wednesday's  meeting, it was decided that the Fed would maintain  near-zero interest rates  to stimulate the economy. It announced that it plans  to  end its program of buying back {w|United States Treasury security|treasury bonds} by the end of June, a program receiving criticism from {w|Republican Party|Republicans} concerned about the {w|Deficit|budget deficit}. Bernanke¡¯s  exchange with reporters, called "historic" by the Los Angeles Times,  was the first of a series of  regular news conferences  planned to be held quarterly by Bernanke to provided the Fed with more transparency. He was cautious in his remarks.   He made no news but  explained in general terms the Fed's policy. He said the Fed is attempting  to revive the US economy  by creating jobs and keeping {w|inflation} low."The trade-offs are getting less attractive at this point," Bernanke said. "Inflation has gotten higher ¡­ it's not clear we can get substantial improvements in payrolls without some additional inflation risk."During the conference, Bernanke said he recognized  that the average American was unhappy with  the  increasing inflation and the  slow job growth, but said the Fed projected that  long-term inflation will remain stable while he acknowledged the effects of  the short-term price increases which he said were driven largely by the increase in the price of oil."There¡¯s not much the Federal Reserve can do about gas prices, per se, at least not without derailing growth entirely, which certainly is not the right way to go," Bernanke said. "After all, the Fed can¡¯t create more oil." When asked by reporters to explain his vague answers, he gave general replies. For example, when asked to clarify  the Fed's intention to maintain near-zero interest rates  for an "extended period" he said the wording suggested this period would probably continue  through a couple more policymaking meetings at least."Unfortunately, the reason we use this vaguer terminology is we don¡¯t know with certainty how quickly response will be required," he said.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said of Bernanke's performance at the press conference, "He was well-prepared and did exactly what he wanted to do - do no harm."== Sources == 
[[Steve Jobs denies 'location-gate']]Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs announced on Wednesday that {w|iPhone} technology is not being used to monitor the location of its customers.

[[Egyptian politician ElBaradei says ousted President Mubarak must stand trial]]Egyptian politician Mohamed ElBaradei said that ousted President Hosni Mubarak must stand trial. His statement follows the recent ratification by Egyptian Foreign Minister {w|Nabil El Araby} of a statute that ensures Egypt will join the jurisdiction of the {w|International Criminal Court}. If ElBaradei assumes power in the coming October/November 2011 elections, Mubarak and other former high-ranking corrupt Egyptian officials could potentially be tried in The Hague.In an interview with the Islam Times, ElBaradei cited reasons as to why the trial of Hosni Mubarak will be necessary to undertake if he chooses to run for Egypt's top job. "Mubarak allegedly issued the order to shoot at the protesters. [That should] have been reason enough to arrest him immediately...The Military Council has no other option than to try Mubarak and bring everyone else to justice who is responsible for human rights violations or corruption," he said.ElBaradei's previous statement to {w|CNN} during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution which began on the 25th of January, according to {w|The Jerusalem Post}, was that a trial was unnecessary and that what primarily needed to be done was for Mubarak to hand back money, speculated to be as much as {w|United States dollar|$}70 billion, which Mubarak illegally took over the course of his 30 year reign and now owes to the Egyptian people in order for economic progress to emerge.ElBaradei has stated he believes Egypt should be run by 'institutions' rather than 'individuals' and has said, "I want to come up with a renaissance project for Egypt and not an electoral program for ElBaradei".== Sources == 
[[Deadly tornadoes rip through southern US, killing over 300]]A huge thunderstorm system  spawning massive tornadoes ripped  through the south-eastern  US  Wednesday evening and early Thursday morning, killing at least 306 people in six states and causing  wide spread property damage.  Some 173 tornadoes have been reported from New York to Texas.  In the worst hit state of  Alabama, at least 210 are confirmed  dead, including 36 in {w|Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa} alone.Deaths also were reported in  Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and  Kentucky. Up to  one million people in Alabama were without power.  A nuclear power plant was shut down in Alabama after it lost power to its three units, an operation of  the plant's safety systems.Seven states have declared a state of emergency, and federal aid  is being sent to Alabama. {w|Robert J. Bentley|Governor  Robert J. Bentley} said he was activating  2,000 Alabama National Guard personell to  aid in  search and rescue. President Barack Obama, who plans to visit Alabama on Friday to view the destruction,  sent a message of condolence to the governor:"Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives because of the tornadoes that have swept through Alabama and the southeastern United States. Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by this devastation, and we commend the heroic efforts of those who have been working tirelessly to respond to this disaster. I just spoke to Governor Bentley and told him that I have ordered the Federal Government to move quickly in our response and informed him that I approved his request for emergency Federal assistance, including search and rescue assets. While we may not know the extent of the damage for days, we will continue to monitor these severe storms across the country and stand ready to continue to help the people of Alabama and all citizens affected by these storms."Preliminary estimates of the tornado hitting  Tuscaloosa suggest it tore along the ground for 176 miles and contained  winds up to 200 miles per hour. The devastation included residential and commercial areas, as well as  the city's  infrastructure and civic buildings."I don't know how anyone survived," said  Mayor Walter Maddox of Tuscaloosa. "We're used to tornadoes here in Tuscaloosa. It's part of growing up. But when you look at the path of destruction that's likely 5 to 7 miles long in an area half a mile to a mile wide ... it's an amazing scene. There's parts of the city I don't recognize, and that's someone that's lived here his entire life."Officials did not want to give specific numbers for death toll and destruction  in specific states, as the extent of the damage and human injury and death is not completely known.  According the the Los Angeles Times, "Mississippi officials reported 32 dead, Tennessee raised its report to 29, Georgia reported 13, Virginia said it had eight deaths and Kentucky reported at least one death. The number of injured was in the hundreds, with that number also expected to rise.""In terms of the ground-up damage and quite possibly the insured damage, this event will be of historic proportions," Jose Miranda, from EQECAT, a catastrophe risk modeling firm,The severe weather warning has been  continued through Thursday, and includes  parts of New York, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This  outbreak of tornadoes is considered the deadliness since 1974 when more than 300 were killed in a {w|Super Outbreak|tornado outbreak}. On March 18, 1925,  695 people died in {w|Tri-State Tornado|a storm}. Greg Carbin,  meteorologist at the {w|National Weather Service}, said, "May is usually the most active tornado month.

[[Sixteen killed in Marrakech, Morocco bomb blast]]At least sixteen people are reported killed in a terrorist bombing in the city of {w|Marrakech, Morocco|Marrakech}, Morocco. The bombing occurred in the busy Argana caf¨¦ before lunch time, Thursday. The caf¨¦, located in the popular {w|Jemaa el-Fnaa} square, is within what is known as the {w|Medina quarter|old city}. The square,  a {w|World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site} and one of the country's top tourist attractions, draws many foreign visitors. Early reports blamed a gas can catching fire. Witness reports indicate the blast destroyed the entire second floor of the caf¨¦, blasting off the terrace and roof demolishing the front of the building.Photographer Tarek Bozid reported, "Everything was covered in blood. The scene was horrifying. Tables were broken and glass was shattered." Ten of the victims were foreign, including six French nationals and one Briton. Half of the dead are reported to be women; and, at least 20 other people were critically wounded including a number foreigners. Two Swiss nationals, two Russians, two Tunisians and two Dutch tourists are reported to be amongst those injured.Although the blast was at first considered an accident, the Interior Ministry confirmed it was an intentional act.  "Analysis of the early evidence collected at the site of the blast confirms the theory of an attack," he said in a statement issued through the official {w|Maghreb Arabe Presse} news agency. Medics said nails, often used in suicide bombs, were found in the bodies of most victims.  French President {w|Nicolas Sarkozy} has expressed his outrage, considering it to be "heinous, cruel and cowardly". The act has been condemned by leaders internationally. French foreign minister {w|Alain Juppe} stated he is unaware of any particular threat to France in Morroco, once a French protectorate.This is the first major attack on Morocco since the {w|2003 Casablanca bombings}, which killed 45 and injured more than 100.== Sources ==

I would be very surprised indeed if, in total, the tourist income from the event were less than the cost of the event itself.To be honest, this is one of the nicer ways we could spend taxpayers money - I'd rather this than spending it on MPs' expenses, bankers' bonuses, or killing people in the Middle East.I've always been of the opinion that the royals do little good, but certainly no harm. They attract tourists, and would hopefully act as a last resort to block a total government takeover by a lunatic - I doubt the queen would give assent to that - but that's an unlikely event. But tourism gets a boost. And since my town was built entirely out of fish and tourists, I'm not going to say anything bad about tourism ;-)
[[Swiss mountaineer Erhard Loretan dies in climbing accident]]Acclaimed Swiss mountaineer {w|Erhard Loretan} died Thursday on his 52nd birthday  when he fell in a climbing accident.According to Swiss police, Loretan was climbing with a client to the summit of {w|Gr¨¹nhorn|Gruenhor}, a 4,043 meter peak in the {w|Bernese Alps}, when both fell for unknown reasons from a height of  around 3,800 metres. He was killed immediately while his client was hospitalized in serious condition.Loretan, originally from  {w|Fribourg}, was eleven years old when he began climbing. In 1982, he  climbed his first 8,000-meter peak,  {w|Nanga Parbat} in Pakistan. He  was the third person to summit all fourteen of the world's {w|Eight-thousander|8,000-meter peaks}, which he accomplished by the age of 36. This confirmed his reputation as one of the world's top mountain climbers.  In 1986 he ascended {w|Mt. Everest} in 40 hours without using supplementary oxygen, a feat that astonished other mountain climbers.Saying that he was essentially a solitary person, he told a {w|Trento} film festival in a video posted on its web site last year, "First of all I¡¯d like to thank the mountains, for almost 40 years they have allowed me to climb, and with this passion I¡¯ve lived an extraordinary life up to now, that¡¯s why I¡¯d like to thank them."He added, "I now want to share this passion more with others, and it¡¯s because of this that being a {w|mountain guide} is a good profession because you can help someone who dreams about climbing mountains.

He plead guilty in 2003 and received a four-month suspended sentence.  The case ignited a debate in Switzerland over shaking babies.== Sources ==

[[Osama bin Laden killed in U.S. operation in Pakistan, White House says]]U.S. officials last night said Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader and orchestrator of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and embassy bombings in 1998, had been killed by U.S. special forces in {w|Abbottabad}, Pakistan near the capital Islamabad.White House officials say that four others were killed in the forty-minute raid that began at 2000 UTC yesterday¡ªincluding a woman said to have been used as a human shield. One of those shot is thought to be bin Laden's son. An American helicopter was lost due to mechanical failure, but no U.S. forces or civilians were killed.U.S. President Barack Obama announced the news in a statement late last night. "I can report to the American people and to the world, that the U.S. has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden," Obama said. He confirmed he had been told in August of a lead to the location of bin Laden, and approved the operation last week. The operation involved a "small team of Americans", Obama said.The operation, led by the CIA, occurred nearly ten years after the 9/11 attacks. CIA director {w|Leon Panetta} notified U.S. legislators Sunday about the news. His body was verified using several methods, including {w|DNA testing} with DNA from a dead sister's body, stored in a Boston, Massachusetts hospital, as well as facial recognition. However, staff at the hospital in question¡ª{w|Massachusetts General Hospital}¡ªhave not been able to "find any evidence" of the body ever being stored there. U.S. officials said his body was then buried at sea at around 0600 UTC today, "in accordance with Islamic law and traditions" and because of the difficulty of finding a country that would accept the remains of the world's most wanted man. Saudi Arabia, the country in which Osama bin Laden was born, refused a U.S. offer to take the body.Following the President's announcement, people started gathering in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., {w|Times Square} and {w|Ground Zero}¡ªthe site of the {w|World Trade Center}¡ªin New York, to celebrate; singing the {w|The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem}. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, said he hoped the death of bin Laden would "bring some closure and comfort to all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001".The U.S. government is reportedly expecting al-Qaeda to soon release what they are likely to call a "martyr tape"¡ªan audio recording made by bin Laden to be broadcast after his death.Although the death of the 54-year-old bin Laden, who was the most wanted person in the world, was greeted with celebration in the U.S., analysts have warned that al-Qaeda will "undoubtedly" launch a retaliatory attack. "I think the significance of what has happened cannot really be overstated," John Gearson, director of the Centre for Defence Studies at {w|King's College London}, said. "There will be concerns that there could be some sort of retaliation, that al-Qaeda may well want to demonstrate that they are still strong and still in the game." He warned that U.S. officials may "lose their focus" after such a major victory, "and that will provide an opportunity for the remnants of al-Qaeda to reform and grow stronger."Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Secretary of State, appealed to Islamic militant fighters to use the opportunity of bin Laden's death to abandon their groups. "Our message to the Taliban remains the same, but today it may have even greater resonance: you cannot wait us out," she said. "You cannot defeat us. But you can make the choice to abandon Al Qaeda and cooperate in a peaceful political process."The president of the {w|European Parliament}, {w|Jerzy Buzek}, said that "we have waken up in a safer world", with the news bringing "safety to millions of people", whilst U.S. senator John McCain sought to remind the American people to "be mindful that al-Qaeda and its terrorist allies are still lethal and determined enemies". The {w|Kremlin} reiterated that "revenge is inescapable for all terrorists", and that "only a joint struggle against global terrorism can bring a result".The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, William Hague, sought to remind people bin Laden was "the world's most prominent leader", going on to say that "it was of great importance that he was still alive and active, and it is unequivocally a good thing that he is no longer able to pursue terror, murder and mayhem in the world". Mentioning that security at British embassies worldwide have been increased in the wake of the news, he reiterated that the death of the al-Qaeda leader was a "serious blow", and that, "like any organisation that has suffered a serious blow, they will want to show in some way that they are still able to operate".Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, welcomed the news, along with many other European countries. He praised the "tenacity" of the U.S. attack, congratulating the "major blow" the move dealt to al-Qaeda. Eight French citizens were killed last week in a bomb blast in {w|Marrakesh}, and, although no group has yet claimed responsibility, it is speculated that al-Qaeda were behind the attack. Sarkozy paid homage to them, as well as other around the world, saying the "victims received justice today and France has thoughts for them and their families".Pakistani officials were not informed of the planned raid, with the White House saying this was "essential to the security of the operation and our personnel". However Obama emphasised that cooperation with Pakistan had helped in finding bin Laden. The operation, described by one senior White House official as "a surgical raid by a small team designed to minimise collateral damage", was not intended to take bin Laden alive. "It was a kill mission", said one security official. Bin Laden died after being shot in the head.Witnesses in Abbottabad have described how the U.S. forces carried out the raid on the compound, which had significant security features, including walls up to 18-foot high topped with barbed wire. "We saw four helicopters at around 2am. We were told to switch off lights of our homes and stay inside," one witness, who lives in the town of {w|Bilal} in Abbottabad, said. The man  confirmed he had seen the wreckage of the U.S. military helicopter which crashed after experiencing mechanical difficulties. Pakistan's {w|Ministry of Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs} said in a statement that the U.S. "operation was conducted [by] U.S. forces in accordance with declared U.S. policy that Osama bin Laden will be eliminated in a direct action by the U.S. forces, wherever found in the world", noting that almost "30,000 Pakistani civilians" had been killed in terrorist attacks in recent years, with the "nation fully united in [its] resolve to eliminate terrorism".However, Pervez Musharraf, a former president of Pakistan, criticised the U.S. involvement, describing the operation as a "violation of [Pakistani] sovereignty," and saying the raid was a "a failure of both Pakistani and U.S. intelligence"; he stressed it would have been "far better" if the {w|Pakistani Special Services Group} had carried out the attack. Musharraf went on to say he was "surprised" bin Laden was found in Abbottabad, but added the terrorist leader "had declared war against Pakistan", and that the news came as a "victory for the people of Pakistan and all the peace loving people of the world".The news that bin Laden was hiding just a few hundred metres from {w|Pakistan Military Academy}, a similar institution to the U.S. {w|West Point Academy} or the UK {w|Sandhurst}, has been met with embarrassment on behalf of the Pakistani government, and scepticism from others. "This is a serious blow to the credibility of Pakistan", according to one Pakistani security analyst. Earlier today, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai maintained he knew bin Laden was in Pakistan: "For 10 years we told NATO and the world community but for ten years they didn't listen to our voice. They burned Afghanistan for ten years but Osama was in Islamabad."Whilst many governments worldwide welcomed the death of bin Laden, more than 800 people marched in the Pakistani city of Quetta, paying homage to bin Laden and burning a U.S. flag. According to the organizer, "Bin Laden was the hero of the Muslim world and after his martyrdom he has won the title of great {w|mujahed}". At the march, pro-Taliban and anti-United States sentiments were chanted, before the protesters dispersed peacefully.Although no images of bin Laden's body have been released, the Obama administration is, according to {w|ABC News}, in possession of gruesome photographs: a "massive head wound" where he took a bullet, with "blood and brains clearly visible".The price of oil has dropped following the announcement after speculation that the death of bin Laden will lower the risk of supply disruption in the Middle East, with a barrel of crude oil for June delivery falling by $1.92.
[[Pakistani Taliban threaten revenge attack after bin Laden death; CIA says retaliation is likely]]The {w|Pakistani Taliban} has threatened a revenge attack on the U.S. and senior Pakistani politicians after the killing of Osama bin Laden as {w|Leon Panetta}, the director of the CIA, warns al-Qaeda will "almost certainly" attempt an attack on the U.S. to avenge their leader.U.S. officials warned Americans to ensure they were careful in traveling to unspecified countries where there could be violent retaliatory attacks. "Though bin Laden is dead, al-Qaeda is not," Panetta said. "The terrorists almost certainly will attempt to avenge him, and we must¡ªand will¡ªremain vigilant and resolute."A notice from the {w|U.S. State Department} advised travelers that, "given the uncertainty and volatility of the current situation", they should try to stay inside homes or hotels and avoid large crowds in countries where there is "the enhanced potential for anti-American violence." {w|White House} officials have not yet raised the homeland terrorism threat level, but an anonymous source at the {w|U.S. Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security} said the agency was maintaining a "heightened state of vigilance".U.S. President Barack Obama announced bin Laden had been killed in a television address last night; shortly afterwards, crowds began celebrating outside the {w|White House} and {w|Ground Zero}, where the twin towers of {w|World Trade Center} collapsed after the attacks of September 11, 2001 which have been attributed to bin Laden. However, analysts warned al-Qaeda will "undoubtedly" launch a retaliatory attack.The warning from Scheuer and the CIA came shortly after the Pakistani Taliban said they would attack Pakistani and American targets. "Now Pakistani rulers, {w|President Zardari} and the {w|Pakistan army|army} will be our first targets. America will be our second target," a spokesman for {w|Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan} said.Bin Laden was killed during a raid on a compound in  {w|Abbottabad}, Pakistan near the capital Islamabad. Four others in the compound were reportedly killed in the raid; although a U.S. helicopter crashed, no U.S. forces were killed. His body was buried at sea, in accordance with Islamic scriptures and because no other country would accept his body.John Gearson, director of the Centre for Defence Studies at {w|King's College London}, also said the killing of bin Laden was very significant, and a retaliatory strike is likely. "There will be concerns that there could be some sort of retaliation, that al-Qaeda may well want to demonstrate that they are still strong and still in the game," he said, and warned that U.S. officials may "lose their focus" after such a major victory, "and that will provide an opportunity for the remnants of al-Qaeda to reform and grow stronger."== Sources == 
[[World leaders react to death of Osama bin Laden]]Leaders and officals around the world have issued varied reactions to the announcement that Osama bin Laden has been killed during a U.S. military operation in Pakistan. NATO has insisted it will continue fighting against militants in Afghanistan, and the United Nations said the death of bin Laden marked a "watershed moment in our common global fight against terrorism."Announcing that the al-Qaeda leader had been killed by U.S. special forces during a forty-minute raid on a compound in {w|Abbottabad}, near the capital Islamabad, U.S. President Barack Obama said it was "a good day for America." Speaking at a ceremony to celebrate winners of the {w|Medal of Honor}, Obama praised the "anonymous heroes" who took part in the operation. He said: "We may not always know their names, we may not always know their stories, but they are always there on the front lines of freedom and we are truly blessed. As commander-in-chief, I could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform." The U.N. and the {w|European Parliament} also welcomed the news. Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general, said: "The death of Osama bin Laden, announced by President Obama last night, is a watershed moment in our common global fight against terrorism. The crimes of al-Qaeda touched most continents, bringing tragedy and loss of life to thousands of men, women and children."David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, said the news "will be welcomed right across our country" and was a "massive step forward," but warned the death of bin Laden "does not mark the end of the threat we face from extremist terror." Italian Prime Minster Silvio Berlusconi said: "This is a great outcome in the fight against evil, in the fight against terrorism, a great outcome for the United States and for all democracies".Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the killing of bin Laden was a "decisive strike" at al-Qaeda. "At his command and in his name, terror was enforced into many countries against men women and children, Christians as well as Muslims," she said. "Osama bin Laden suggested that he was operating in the name of Islam, but in reality he makes a mockery of the fundamental values of his own and every other religion."Several Asian countries also said bin Laden's death was a step forward in the war against terrorism. Chinese spokeswoman {w|Jiang Yu} said "China has taken note of the announcement. We believe the death of Osama bin Laden is a milestone and a positive development for the international anti-terrorism efforts." Japan, Malaysia and Singapore also welcomed the news.Australia pledged not to withdraw forces from Afghanistan after the announcement. "Osama bin Laden declared war on innocent people and today he has paid the price for that declaration," Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, said. "The mission in Afghanistan will continue," she added, saying al-Qaeda "will continue". Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, said bin Laden was a "promoter of the ideology of hatred and was the chief of a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of thousands of victims, especially in Muslim countries," and "justice has been done" for the victims of al-Qaeda attacks.
[[Vatican]]Well, I'm not sure on the minority bit, but it truly made me sick. Whats even more annoying is that over youtube and forums, there are people spamming 'O CELEBRATE TEH OSAMA IS DED', etc.Also, that quote is absolutely brilliantly beautiful.
[[Gulf of Mexico]]This link works for me. In addition, passage 009.030 states the following SHAKIR: And the Jews say: Uzair is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away! 
[[One confirmed dead after tornado hits Auckland, New Zealand]]A short-lived tornado with an average wind speed of 200 kilometres per hour hit {w|Auckland}'s North Shore at around 3pm {w|NZT}, passing through the suburb of {w|Albany, New Zealand|Albany} and dissipating across the harbour near Point Chevalier.Among the hardest-hit buildings was the Albany Mega Centre, the local shopping mall, which had its roof torn off. Emergency services were seen tending to a man in his thirties in the car park of the shopping centre, but were unable to resuscitate him. Civil Defence originally stated there were two dead and fourteen known injuries, but later revised the death toll to one. North Shore Hospital is currently treating up to twelve casualties, including one man who has critical injuries, while others are in Waitakere and Auckland Hospitals.Trees and cars were swept up in the tornado, causing  significant damage to property and trapping residents in the vicinity. The North Western motorway was closed but has been reopened, although traffic congestion is still an issue with buses following alternative routes and trains restricted to a temporary speed limit. Auckland Council has activated their emergency coordination centre and the extent of the damage is still being assessed. Prime Minister John Key says that the New Zealand government is monitoring the situation.This tornado is the second one to hit Albany in the last twenty years, with a 1991 tornado also having a death toll of one.== Sources == 
[[U.S. did not inform Pakistan of bin Laden mission because of suspicions he was being harbored by government]]The U.S. did not inform Pakistan of the operation to kill Osama bin Laden because of fears they were harboring the leader of al-Qaeda and would warn him of the mission, a senior American intelligence official has said. Pakistan has defended itself against allegations it was protecting the world's most wanted man, and expressed embarrassment after it emerged bin Laden may have been living in the compound in {w|Abbottabad} for as many as six years without being intercepted by Pakistan intelligence.The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, has attacked "baseless speculation" that Pakistan was harboring bin Laden. The Pakistani foreign ministry also said in a statement that it has "deep concerns and reservations" over the U.S. fears it is sheltering terrorists, and stressed it shared information openly with Washington. But U.S. officials have raised concerns over how Pakistani authorities allowed bin Laden to remain undetected in the country for as many as six years, and tensions are likely to be further strained after the {w|White House} announced it would be throughly investigating claims bin Laden had "benefactors" and a "support system" inside Pakistan. {w|John O. Brennan|John Brennan}, a senior counterterrorism official, said: "We are looking right now at how he was able to hold out there for so long."Denying they were providing a shelter for bin Laden, Pakistani officials expressed "embarrassment" over failing to detect his presence so close to the capital; they said a full investigation would be launched. "We will inquire into the causes of what happened but it's really important not to turn it into any allegation of complicity," the Pakistani ambassador to Washington, {w|Husain Haqqani}, said. But Western politicians have expressed skepticism as to how the Pakistani government did not know bin Laden was in the country, despite him living a short distance from the leading elite military training academy. U.S. Senator {w|Lindsey Graham} asked: "How could he be in such a compound without being noticed?"It emerged yesterday that bin Laden's daughter had told Pakistani officials that her father had initially been captured by the  U.S. forces and then killed. The White House said on Tuesday that bin Laden had been unarmed during the raid, but the {w|U.S. Navy Seals} did meet resistance from other people in the building; it is thought as many as 18 people may have been in the compound. The U.S. left several people behind, including six children; afterwards, Pakistani authorities arrested everyone in the compound. "If he had surrendered, attempted to surrender, I think we should obviously have accepted that, but there was no indication that he wanted to do that and therefore his killing was appropriate," U.S. attorney general {w|Eric Holder} said yesterday. But the claim by bin Laden's 12-year-old daughter that U.S. forces captured him and then shot him dead in front of his family appear to contradict this statement. The U.S. has also been forced to defend itself against allegations that the raid was unlawful, and claims that bin Laden was not a legitimate target. Holder told a Senate committee the killing of the al-Qaeda leader was "an act of national self-defence".More details have been emerging about how Bin Laden was killed in a raid by {w|U.S. special forces} on a compound not far from Islamabad over the weekend. The U.S. seized computer equipment and mobile telephones from the compound, which will be analysed with the hope they will reveal more information about the workings of al-Qaeda. U.S. president Barack Obama announced the raid on Sunday night. "I can report to the American people and to the world, that the U.S. has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden," Obama said, and confirmed he had been told in August of a lead to the location of the al-Qaeda leader. Four other people were killed in the raid on the compound; the U.S. sustained no casualties. The body of bin Laden was buried at sea.Last night Obama officially decided the U.S. will not release images of bin Laden's corpse, which have been described as "very gruesome". In an interview to be aired on {w|CBS News}, Obama will say: "The risks of release outweigh the benefits." Skeptics have demanded the U.S. release the photographs of the corpse, and officials in the White House have been debating whether to do so for the past several days. But Obama is to add that {w|conspiracy threory|conspiracy theorists} "will just claim the photos are doctored anyway," and say his decision was partly based on fears that there could be anger in the Middle East if the images were released. "Osama bin Laden is not a trophy¡ªhe is dead and let's now focus on continuing the fight until al-Qaeda has been eliminated." The images are reported to show bin Laden shot above the left eye, with parts of his brain exposed.After it was announced on Sunday night that bin Laden had been killed, many Americans begun gathering in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., {w|Times Square} and {w|Ground Zero}¡ªthe site of the {w|World Trade Center}¡ªin New York, to celebrate, singing the {w|The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem}. Reports have indicated the U.S. government is awaiting the release of a "martyr tape"¡ªan audio recording made by bin Laden to be broadcast after his death. Many world leaders have said the killing of bin Laden marks a major turning point on the war on terror. "Osama bin Laden suggested that he was operating in the name of Islam, but in reality he makes a mockery of the fundamental values of his own and every other religion," Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said. But NATO said it would continue the {w|war in Afghanistan} to ensure the country "never again becomes a safe haven for extremism, but develops in peace and security."The White House also confirmed they expect al-Qaeda may launch a retaliatory attack after bin Laden's death. "We have anticipated a backlash, a desire, if not the ability, to exact some sort of revenge," a spokesperson said. {w|Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan} has threatened to launch attacks in Pakistan and the U.S. in revenge for the death of bin Laden. Panetta said: "Though bin Laden is dead, al-Qaeda is not. The terrorists almost certainly will attempt to avenge him, and we must¡ªand will¡ªremain vigilant and resolute." The U.S. has issued notices advising travelers to avoid large crowds in foreign countries.== Sources == 
[[Flight recorders from Air France Flight 447 found]]Officials from France's aviation accident investigation agency, the {w|Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety}, announced on Tuesday that they had recovered the {w|cockpit voice recorder} of {w|Air France Flight 447}. It was located and brought to the surface by a Remora 6000 unmanned submarine, then taken aboard the ?le de Sein, one of the vessels taking part in the recovery and salvage efforts.This came two days after an announcement on Sunday that the crash-survivable memory unit of the {w|flight data recorder} of the aircraft had been located and brought to the surface. The chassis of the FDR was located on April 27, with the memory unit missing. It was found a short distance from the chassis. It was also brought to the surface by the Remora 6000.With the recovery of both recorders, which are reported to be "in good condition", French officials hope to determine what caused the {w|Airbus A330-200} to crash into the {w|Atlantic Ocean} on June 1, 2009, when it departed Rio de Janeiro's {w|Gale?o International Airport} before it was lost 600 miles off the coast of Brazil en route to Paris' {w|Charles de Gaulle Airport} with 228 passengers and crew on board.The leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's {w|pitot tubes}, devices which measure how fast the aircraft is traveling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash. The plane's {w|Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System} sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.However, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, Phil Seymour, speaking to {w|CNN}, believes the memory unit will not be of much use to investigators saying because of the depth it was located at,  "If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split and you have the corrosive effects of seawater and the depths involved." Seymour believes the wreckage will help reveal what happened as more is recovered."It may be that the more wreckage they find will help them to piece it all together, which bit by bit could help them build a picture of what caused the plane to come down," he added.A BEA spokesperson had agreed with that possibility a few days earlier when speaking to the Associated Press about the recovery of the flight data recorder. "We can't say in advance that we're going to be able to read it until it's been opened," the spokesperson said. AsThe wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found back on April 8 at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters, by a team from the {w|Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution}, using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar. After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage. The location of the recorders were localized within 2 square miles of the flight's last position last year.In March, a French judge placed the European aircraft maker Airbus and {w|Air France} under investigation for possible involuntary manslaughter charges in the 2009 crash. Both are paying the cost of the search which is estimated to be $12.7 million. The crash is the deadliest in Air France's history.== Sources == 
[[DR Congo transport minister sacked after numerous boat accidents]]A spokesman for the government released a statement saying that Kawanda had failed to "ensure that regulations related to navigation are respected." Information minister {w|Lambert Mende} commented on Ms Kawanda's sacking, saying, "She should have introduced rules to prevent boats travelling at night and to stop cargo boats from carrying passengers. We don't have the exact number [of victims] but we think it is probably considerably higher than what has already been reported."He added that the government will be paying for the funerals of the victims.Fatal boat accidents are a common occurrence in DR Congo. On the same river where Monday's accident happened, up to 200 people died last year when a boat capsized. According to the Red Cross, 40 people died when an overcrowded boat sank on {w|Lake Kivu} last week.
[[Obama decides against the release of graphic photos of bin Laden]]U.S. President Barack Obama decided on Wednesday not to release graphic images of Osama bin Laden¡¯s corpse after a debate with his war council. Obama feared the photographs could spur on retaliatory attacks and reprisals against the United States and its allies. In an interview to be aired on {w|CBS News}, Obama will say: "The risks of release outweigh the benefits." Skeptics have demanded the U.S. release the photographs of the corpse, and officials in the White House have been debating whether to do so for the past several days. But Obama is to add that {w|conspiracy threory|conspiracy theorists} "will just claim the photos are doctored anyway," and say his decision was partly based on fears that there could be anger in the Middle East if the images were released. "Osama bin Laden is not a trophy¡ªhe is dead and let's now focus on continuing the fight until al-Qaeda has been eliminated."According to {W|White House} officials, Secretary of Defense {W|Robert Gates} and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advised Obama not to release images because of, as they argued, the potential national security risk. It would do little to convince sceptics that the leader and founder of al-Qaeda had been killed after a raid on his compound on Monday. The images are reported to show bin Laden shot above the left eye, with parts of his brain exposed.The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, {W|Leon Panetta}, however, argued for the release of the images. "The bottom line is that, you know, we got Bin Laden and I think we have to reveal to the rest of the world the fact that we were able to get him and kill him." Panetta added that the eventual release of the photos was inevitable.According to White House sources, Obama is of the opinion there is not sufficient scepticism worldwide to warrant the release of the pictures. Similarly, officials said those doubting Bin Laden's death were unlikely to be convinced by a photograph in today's age of photo manipulation.== Sources == 
[[Queensland cab conversations to be recorded]]State officials in Queensland, Australia, have begun working on a draft protocol to use security cameras to record conversations in {w|taxi}s. The new draft proposes to change a current policy which allows for cameras in taxis which do not record sound for privacy reasons, in the hope that audio recordings will make some investigations easier.The paper, which says audio recordings would "provide greater certainty with regard to investigations, particularly in situation of conflicting statements," is currently at the Transport and Main Roads department. The proposal also suggests extending the time taxi companies can keep recordings downloaded from security cameras from the current 30¨C35 days.The chairman of one taxi company said the proposed measure would increase the safety of his drivers. "In 2006 the government introduced the security cameras and most cabs now have {w|GPS} units," he said. "What we've got now is an improvement over having nothing at all and as a result there has been a fair improvement in the reduction of assaults on taxi drivers." To address privacy concerns, the paper proposes to add stickers to the entry points at the taxis. The text will read, "Security cameras and microphones fitted. You will be photographed. Conversations will be recorded". However, the legislation draft has met opposition from some. {w|Scott Emerson}, a spokesperson for the {w|Liberal National Party of Queensland}, objected to the measure on privacy grounds. "We need to know how these recordings are going to be used," he said. "Who's going to have access to them?"Queensland's privacy commissioner Linda Matthews reacted said the recordings would be used for genuine law enforcement purposes. {w|Annastacia Palaszczuk}, Queensland's Transport Minister, said the ideas within the proposal would be heavily considered before being implemented. She said: "If people think it's a good idea then we go to full consultation. I would be meeting with the privacy commissioner, I'd be meeting with the taxi industry, I'd be consulting with members of the public in a much more formal way."== Sources == 
[[Al-Qaeda says bin Laden death will 'not be wasted'; Pentagon releases videos of terrorist leader in compound]]{date|May 7, 2011}{Politics and conflicts}  Al-Qaeda has said it will continue to launch more terrorist attacks on the U.S. and warned the death of their leader Osama bin Laden, would "not be wasted". The statement from the organization, posted on {w|jihadist} internet forums, came as the {w|the Pentagon|Pentagon} released videos filmed inside the terrorist leader's compound which was raided last weekend. Intelligence officials said at a briefing in Washington, D.C. that the videos showed that bin Laden was still playing an active role in al-Qaeda plotting.Although the video tapes have no audio, they show bin Laden watching news coverage of himself on television and preparing to record a propaganda film. The tapes are the latest intelligence to emerge from computer equipment seized from bin Laden's compound during the raid on his compound in {w|Abbottabad}, Pakistan by {w|U.S. special forces} last weekend. Earlier this week it emerged bin Laden had been planning an attack on the American rail network on the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks this year. U.S. officials yesterday stressed that the al-Qaeda plot was only "aspirational", but involved derailing multiple trains by damaging rail lines at various sites. Tonight one intelligence official said the information gleaned from the computers was the "single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever." The computer equipment also revealed that there were hopes of attacking major transportation hubs, and that during the six years he lived at the compound in Pakistan, bin Laden stayed in close contact with senior affiliates and played an active role in developing terrorist plots. An unnamed U.S. official told {w|The New York Times} that bin Laden "wasn't just a figurehead," but "continued to plot and plan, to come up with ideas about targets and to communicate those ideas to other senior al-Qaeda leaders."Confirming the death of bin Laden in a statement this week, al-Qaeda said his killing would be a "curse" on the U.S. and its allies. "Their happiness will turn into sorrow, and their blood will be mixed with their tears. We call upon our Muslim people in Pakistan, on whose land Sheikh Osama was killed, to rise up and revolt." The revelation that al-Qaeda was planning more attacks against the U.S. comes only several days after officials warned the terrorist group was likely to be plotting a revenge attack to avenge the death of bin Laden.Four days after the raid on the compound, U.S. president Barack Obama visited {w|World Trade Center site|Ground Zero} in New York on Thursday to pay tribute to the 3,000 people killed in the September 11 attacks, for which al-Qaeda was found responsible. Bin Laden is believed to have masterminded the attacks on the {w|Twin Towers} and the {w|the Pentagon|Pentagon}. "When we say we will never forget, we mean what we say," Obama told firefighters in the city. He laid a {w|wreath} made from red, white and blue flowers after meeting with relatives of the victims of the attacks. "We are going to make sure that the perpetrators of that horrible act will see justice," he said. After the wreath was laid, he stood with his head bowed for a {w|moment of silence}.The news of bin Laden's death after a team of {w|U.S. Navy Seals} descended into the compound was greeted with celebrations across the U.S. on Sunday night, but concerns have been raised as to whether the killing was lawful after the terrorist leader's daughter told Pakistani authorities that he had been captured and then killed. But Attorney General {w|Eric Holder} contradicted the statement, saying: "If he had surrendered, attempted to surrender, I think we should obviously have accepted that, but there was no indication that he wanted to do that and therefore his killing was appropriate."Obama's visit came a day after he announced he would not be releasing images of bin Laden's body. In an interview to be aired on {w|CBS News}, the president said: "It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool." The images¡ªdescribed as "very gruesome"¡ªare reported to show bin Laden shot above the left eye, with parts of his brain exposed.As Obama travelled to New York, the growing rift between the relations of the U.S. and Pakistan was continuing to grow after officials in Islamabad said the U.S. president may have breached U.N. rules by ordering the raid, because Pakistan was not told in advance. Senior officials within the {w|Pakistani army} also ordered the number of American military personnel in the country to be cut to "minimum essential" levels. {w|Salman Bashir}, the Pakistani foreign secretary, strained relations further at a press conference when he said there were serious concerns that the U.S. had breached U.N. resolutions on {w|sovereignty}, and said Pakistan is determined to "uphold our sovereignty and safeguard our security". Pakistani army officials risked tautening relations between the two countries again on Thursday as they announced they would consider cutting ties with Washington, D.C. if the U.S. mounted another unannounced raid on their soil, and said they would be expelling U.S. military personnel in retaliation.The conflict stems from the raid during the weekend on the Abbottabad compound. Pakistan says it was not informed about the raid, which involved U.S. helicopters flying into Pakistani airspace to drop commandos who raided the house. The rift has grown further after U.S. officials questioned how Pakistani intelligence allowed bin Laden to live in the compound, a short distance from a military training academy, and suggested the terrorist leader may have been harbored by the government. The director of the CIA said earlier this week that Pakistan was not informed about the raid because of fears he was being harbored by Pakistani officials who might warn him about the raid. The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, dismissed "baseless speculation" that his administration was sheltering bin Laden. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted tension between Washington and Pakistan over the raid had been exaggerated, and said she was keen to keep relations with Islamabad. "It is not always an easy relationship. You know that," she said. "But, on the other hand, it is a productive one for both our countries and we are going to continue to cooperate between our governments, our militaries, our law-enforcement agencies, but most importantly between the American and Pakistani people."== Sources == 
[[UK holds referendum on voting system]]The United Kingdom electorate took to the polls yesterday to vote in both local elections and a UK-wide referendum regarding the system used to elect its members of parliament to the {w|House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons}. The polls opened at 07:00 {w|British Summer Time|BST} yesterday morning and closed at 22:00 BST last night.Alongside the normal local elections for seats on 279 councils, and elections for seats in the devolved {w|Scottish Parliament} and the {w|Welsh Assembly|Welsh} and {w|Northern Irish Assembly|Northern Irish} Assemblies, the country saw the first nation-wide referendum since 1975, regarding potentially replacing the current {w|first past the post} voting system with the {w|Alternative Vote} system currently used for general elections in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea, as well as for some mayoral and party leadership elections worldwide, including in the UK.Mayoral elections also took place in {w|Leicester}, {w|Mansfield}, {w|Beford}, {w|Middlesbrough}, and {w|Torbay}. Some areas also experienced elections to parish councils, while the constituency of {w|Leicester South|Leicester South} underwent a by-election after its Labour MP Sir {w|Peter Soulsby} stood down to run for mayor.One polling station in {w|Stockport} was delivered the wrong ballot papers, causing around 90 people to cast invalid votes. Those affected were, where possible, contacted and asked to cast their vote again, according to the local council. Another, in {w|Llandeilo}, was closed for two hours after escaped dogs bit four people nearby.The AV referendum came about as a result of the coalition agreement between the {w|Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats}, who support voting reform and promised a referendum in their campaign, and the {w|Conservative Party|Conservatives}, who initially opposed reform but agreed to a referendum as a compromise, following the election in May last year.The {w|Scottish National Party} hopes to retain control of the Scottish Parliament in {w|Holyrood}, where it currently runs the minority government, in the hopes of potentially holding a referendum regarding Scottish independence, which they did not deliver in their first term in power; meanwhile {w|Labour Party|Labour} hope to end their coalition with {w|Plaid Cymru} by taking control of the Welsh Assembly; however, sources from within the party report that it is likely that Labour will fail to reach a majority. Little is expected to change in Ireland, where the {w|Democratic Unionist Party} and {w|Sinn F¨¦in} are expected to retain their dominance over the Northern Irish Assembly.Polls taken prior to the election implied that AV would be rejected by some margin, but due to low turnout ¡ª despite good weather ¡ª the results are likely to be unpredictable. The results of the AV referendum are not due to be declared until 20:00 BST today, and counting is not due to begin until 16:00 BST.As usual, {w|Sunderland City Council|Sunderland} was the first council to report, and was held by Labour; as is the case with many councils in the north of England, it is considered a Labour safe seat. Early predictions indicate that a number of Liberal Democrat councilors in northern cities will lose their seats to Labour or Conservative candidates. Former Labour {w|Home Secretary} {w|David Blunkett} reportedly said that  the national opinion had changed from "Clegg mania" into "Clegg pneumonia". In an interview with the BBC, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg put predicted Liberal Democrat losses down to voters being "angry" at the coalition government, but also said that the electorate is "not stupid", and would vote in council elections based on local¡ªrather than national¡ªfactors.The first Scottish Parliament constituency to report was {w|Rutherglen|Rutherglen}, which is held by the incumbent Labour MP, {w|James Kelly}. Despite being considered Labour's fourth safest Scottish seat, it experienced a swing of more than seven percent towards the SNP, and large Labour losses are predicted across Scotland. Nearby {w|East Kilbride|East Kilbride} was the second to report, and was gained by SNP candidate {w|Linda Fabiani} from the Labour incumbent {w|Andy Kerr}.
[[Liberal Democrats defeated in UK elections after alternative vote and councils rejected; Salmond wins historic first majority vote]]Nick Clegg, the leader of the {w|Liberal Democrats} and deputy prime minister in the United Kingdom {w|United Kingdom coalition government|coalition government}, has today conceded a "bitter blow" after suffering two major defeats as the electorate {w|United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|rejected} the {w|Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote system} and his party was battered by its worst local election defeat in 30 years. The {w|Scottish National Party|SNP} also won the historic first majority vote in the history of Scotland, which will pave the way for a referendum on {w|Scottish independence|independence}.The electorate overwhelmingly rejected the alternative vote; 68 percent voting "no" to 32 percent voting "yes". The rejection was the second defeat for the Liberal Democrat leader today after the party also lost seats across the country. Gary Long, leader of the Liberal Democrats on {w|Nottingham City Council}, who lost his seat to {w|Labour Party|Labour} today, has publicly called for Clegg to resign after the electoral defeats. The Liberal Democrat mayor of {w|Chorley} accused Clegg of "letting the party down", and a third party leader said he should "think about his position".Clegg, who campaigned to implement the alternative vote, was today forced to concede his party had taken a disappointing loss in failing to win the alternative vote, and sustained "big knocks" in the council elections because it was "getting the brunt of the blame" for spending cuts implemented by the coalition. While it was a good day for the {w|Conservative Party|Conservatives}¡ªwho gained two more council seats¡ªClegg had lost almost half his council seats, many to Labour. {w|Ed Miliband}, the Labour leader, said the backlash against Clegg sent "a clear message" to the Liberal Democrats "that there needs to be a change of direction on some of the key issues". Many families who rejected his party, Clegg said, feared a return to {w|Thatcherism}. "We need to get up, dust ourselves down and move on," he said.But tonight leading "yes" campaigners admitted they had been defeated. {w|Chris Huhne}, a Liberal Democrat minister who campaigned in support of the alternative vote, said: "The rejection has been overwhelming and we accept that." He said the public had resoundingly rejected the alternative vote, and suggested any attempt "to find some sort of backdoor method to bring something in that is not first past the post will be seen to have snubbed the clear wishes of the electorate." Counting of the ballots, which were cast yesterday across the country, is continuing tonight, but the "no" vote has already passed the winning post. {w|Voter turnout} was a higher-than-expected 41 percent.As turmoil spreads within the Liberal Democrats, there are also reports of tension between the two coalition parties¡ªClegg campaigned in support of the system, but his Conservative coalition partner David Cameron campaigned against it. Although senior politicians within the coalition insist there are no differences after the campaign over the alternative vote, differences are thought to be mounting within the government. {w|Paddy Ashdown}, a former Liberal Democrat leader, today said the "goodwill and trust" between the coalition parties had all but dissolved.In Scotland, the SNP won a majority vote for the first time in the history of the country after the Liberal Democrat vote collapsed and Labour suffered an unpredicted defeat, allowing the party leader, Alex Salmond, to hold a {w|referendum} on Scottish independence. "Just as the Scottish people have restored trust in us, we must trust the people as well," he said. "Which is why, in this term of the parliament, we will bring forward a referendum and trust the people on Scotland's own constitutional future." Following a series of defeats for senior Labour politicians in Scotland the party leader, {w|Iain Grey}, announced his resignation. Cameron congratulated Salmond for his "emphatic win", but said he would fight Scottish independence "with every single fibre that I have."Vote counting has begun in Northern Ireland, but the full layout of the {w|Northern Ireland Assembly|Assembly} will not be known before tomorrow evening. Meanwhile, Labour missed out on an overall majority in the {w|Welsh Assembly} by one seat; it now appears they may form an alliance with the Liberal Democrats. {w|Carwyn Jones}, the leader of the Labour party in Wales said the electorate wanted them to govern, but refused to dismiss the prospect of an alliance. "The one thing the people of Wales have said very clearly to us is they want Labour to stand up for them and they want Labour to lead the next Welsh government," he said. "Over the next few days all the parties will be considering their positions. The opposition parties have had some severe disappointments and things need to settle before they think about their position."== Sources == 
[[27 believed dead in Indonesian plane crash]]Officials say 27 people are dead after a plane crashed into the sea off east Indonesia today. Fifteen bodies have been recovered and it is thought the others on board have sunk with the wreckage."I can confirm that all the passengers were killed when the plane exploded as it crashed into the sea," an {w|Indonesian navy} official told local radio station {W|ElShinta}. He said around ten navy divers were sent to the {W|Papua, Indonesia|Papua} crash site 400 metres off-shore in six kilometres of water but "had difficulties locating them [trapped passengers] due to strong currents and limited equipment."The nation of islands has heavy use of aviation and a poor safety record, including the crash of an Adam Air jet in 2007 that killed 102 people near {W|Sulawesi}. The {W|European Commission} had banned all Indonesian airlines from entering it, but two years ago flag carrier Garuda Indonesia was deemed to have improved and allowed to enter.== Sources == 
[[Australia, Malaysia closing in on refugee agreement]]Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard is undergoing the final stages of an {W|Australian dollar|AU$}292 million bilateral agreement with Malaysian counterpart {W|Dato Sri Najib Tun Razak} to relocate 800 asylum seekers who arrive illegally by boat away from the Australian mainland for detention and processing. In exchange Gillard will expand Australia¡¯s humanitarian efforts by assisting in the resettling of 4,000 persons of genuine refugee status, currently living in Malaysia, over a period of 4 years.This move by the Gillard Government stems from a meeting held by both the Australian and Malaysian leaders on March 30 at a Regional Co-Operation-themed Ministerial Conference in {W|Bali}, Indonesia. Gillard had previously tried unsuccessfully to pitch the relocation of asylum seekers to East Timor and talks about such with Papua New Guinea are ongoing, although PNG says a previously closed centre will remain closed. Immigration Minister {W|Chris Bowen} noted that this agreement may be controversial but, "[a]s the Prime Minister said, nobody should doubt our resolve to break the people smugglers' business model."Opposition leader Tony Abbott says that this agreement harkens back to the original {W|Politics of Australia|Howard Government} migration policy which began in 2001 and was eventually scrapped by the Rudd {W|Australian Labour Party|Labour} Government in 2007. This was known as the '{W|Pacific Solution}' and aimed to relocate asylum seekers who illegally arrived in Australia by relocating and processing them in detention centres in the {W|Pacific Islands} of {W|Christmas Island} and Nauru.     The {W|UN Refugee Agency}'s website notes that while Malaysia hosts an estimated three million refugees and migrants from various countries it is not a signatory to the {W|Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|UN Refugee Convention}. This, it believes, will complicate the status determination of refugees.== Sources == 
[[Indonesian plane crash leaves 27 believed dead]]No support for removal. Thus I am closing this as it has been over 7 days.  Brian | | New Zealand Portal 04:32, 7 May 2011BarkingFish has an admirable record as an active contributor to the project. However xe has also been involved in some conflict with community members, in particular over a quickness to block, and as often indefinitely as not. In a recent IRC conversation xe asserted the decision to indef block was solely xyr right, as it was intrinsic to being an admin.For this reason, and solely this reason, I would prefer if xe no longer had the responsibility for blocking users.The specific event which pushed this issue to the forefront was the indef block on {user3|Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV} for 'trolling' in the comments namespace, a portion of Wikinews set aside for the expression of personal opinions. The users non-comments page edits are minor copy edits which improved Wikinews's articles. Prior to being indef blocked by BarkingFish the user had never been blocked, had never received a warning from any community member.There were, until very recently, two indef blocks by BarkingFish which were not supported in policy:In my defence against this frankly annoying allegation, I wish to state that prior to the application of this block, I spoke with a bureaucrat, from which conversation went something like this:B-R-S If you want to say he's an obvious troll and not really a holder of those views - i.e. just causing trouble - and block him, I won't argue.BarkingFish B-R-S: Obvious troll is quite rampantly obviousBarkingFish In the bin he goes.BarkingFish I'm going to slap an indef on Ungolli...whatever the **** he's called.BarkingFish He is clearly clearly trolling and doing nothing else.B-R-S Fine by me, Fish.----I was then highlighted by pizero in #wikinews, enquiring as to the reason for the block.00:12:21 pizero: BarkingFish: what's up with Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV?00:13:15 BarkingFish: blocked for trolling on the LQT00:13:22 BarkingFish: undo it if you think it's wrong00:13:31 BarkingFish: I considered him to be trolling, I nailed him00:15:08 B-R-S: He does look like he doesn't really hold the opinions he spouts - i.e. is causing trouble.A rather heated conversation then followed, during which time Amgine asserted that admins should not indef users, because they don't have the ability to decide that a user has no unredeeming features.  At the end of said conversation, during which varying arguments and unpleasant remarks got bandied about, I then posted this to pizero:01:18:34 BarkingFish: pizero: I'll be frank with you. My work as an admin here, means precisely nothing, when someone tells me I don't have the authority to do what I do.  I will be filing a bug on mediawiki and asking for all administrators to have the right to indefinitely ban users removed.^^This I subsequently did, you can view the request here: https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2871301:23:10 pizero: BarkingFish: You do have the authority.  WN blocking policy is saner than any other I've encountered.  Which isn't to say there isn't always room for all of us to learn going forward; but yes, you definitely have the authority.01:25:36 pizero: BarkingFish, I'm not defending Amgine. And I wondered, asked, and was satisfied about the particular block.----I also confirm that I have specific permission from both mentioned users to publish the IRC related material on this request.01:47:57 B-R-S: Well, I certainly have no objection to you using that bit from me. Transparency & accounability etc. It's only fair that you can quote that.01:50:42 pizero: BarkingFish: Like BRS, I feel morally I should stand by my comments here, so I give you permission to use them.  Which may be needed since the channel specifies no public logging.----In short, I see it as my intrinsic right as an administrator to this project to set a block of whatever length I see fit.  Indef isn't the end of the world, indef is short for indefinite, meaning "indetermined length" in this case.  It could be a week, 3 years, or until hell freezes and satan goes to work on a snowplough.  The block was discussed, reviewed after questioning in irc by another admin, and I feel was well within my rights to apply.In relation to the accusations that I'd "not considered policy", the block on 5starlegacyfoundation was applied because they were writing articles about an organisation which they appeared to be directly involved in, which in a news site, created a conflict of interest in my opinion.  I trust that we don't let organisations spout about themselves here, and applied the block to stop them from promoting their own organisation's work.The Xtzou block was because the account was marked registered here, and it was a KNOWN sockpuppet of another user, indefinitely blocked on another project. The indef was precautionary to prevent them from using the sock here.In the past, if others have considered my blocks to be wrong, I have sometimes discussed them, I have sometimes compromised. But on some, I won't do that, where I consider that the block is required. I justified the block on Ungoliant MMDCLXIV after Brian McNeil lifted it, and you can find that on the Admin alerts board.The ball is now in your court. Hit it however you wish.

[[Swedish Navy confirms investigation of border violation]]The {w|Swedish Navy} have released a picture regarding a foreign submarine discovered in the {w|Saltsj?baden river} of {w|Lake M?laren} in {w|Stockholm}, the capital city of Sweden, situated on the western coast of the {w|Baltic Sea}.The submarine was seen by Hanna Harge, a 40-year-old entrepreneur who lives locally, when walking with her dog on the morning of 13 April this year. She woke up her family, brought them to the location and took pictures of the submarine, before it disappeared. She and her family immediately called the Swedish Navy, believing it to be an exercise, and told them to hide the vessel better. The Navy, however, had no knowledge of such an exercise, and no reports from other nations regarding the submarine. Soon afterwards, the Navy's intelligence agency visited Harge, taking the pictures to technical staff. The Harge family compares them to the submarines of the former {w|Soviet Union} and the early Russian Federation which allegedly violated Sweden's border in the same vicinity.In addition to the {w|Armed Forces of Sweden}, other government agencies are also involved in the investigation such as {w|SMHI} and {w|Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency}. According to Andersson Larsson of the technical staff, the proceedings of the investigation are classified and it is expected to be finished and sent to the {w|Government of Sweden} within two months.== Sources == 
[[Gaddafi loyalists allegedly using Red Cross helicopters to bomb rebel held city]]Forces loyal to besieged Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi have entered into the rebel stronghold of {w|Misrata}, Libya, in helicopters bearing Red Cross markings to drop naval bombs on the port city, continuing a two-month long attack. Gaddafi forces are attempting to cut off humanitarian aid that the rebels are receiving, which primarily comes from ships which dock in Misrata's port from humanitarian organisations. The helicopters reportedly flew over Misrata, the third largest city in the country and located on the northwest coast of Libya, on Thursday and Friday, disguised as aid workers from the Red Cross to circumvent the {w|2011 military intervention in Libya|no-fly zone}, which was approved unanimously by the U.N. Security Council in March. The no-fly zone aims at making it impossible for Gaddafi loyalists to perform airstrikes on the rebels.  NATO, who is aiding the rebels in striking Gaddafi strongholds, stated that helicopters had been spotted flying over Misrata on Thursday, but could not confirm that the helicopters bore the Red Cross logo. A spokesperson did, however, confirm that no humanitarian missions had been scheduled to fly that day. A rebel spokesman told {w|CNN} that helicopters flying over the city on Saturday had Red Cross markings. The same day, Gaddafi's troops were able to destroy six major fuel tanks in the city.  The latest incidents come after Italy confirmed it has not and will not supply the rebels with weapons to use against Gaddafi and his forces, but will consider sending non-lethal weapons such as radars and satellites. However, the rebel {w|National Transitional Council} said opposition representatives were flying to Italy to sign a deal that would see Italy send arms to rebel forces.== Sources == 
[[Passenger flight diverted to New Mexico after 'security threat']]U.S. security officials have cleared a {w|Delta Airlines} passenger jet diverted to New Mexico to take off again because "no suspicious items" had been found.

[[Australian airline Qantas faces engineers strike]]Engineers from the Australian airline Qantas are to hold a one-hour strike on Friday amid fears over job security. The strike will likely cause disruption for thousands of passengers.The strike was called after negotiations between the {w|Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association|ALAEA}, an engineers' union, and the airline, broke down. "What interests us more is job security, and for aircraft engineers that means simply being able to carry out aircraft maintenance in Australia," Steve Purvinas, the secretary of the ALAEA, said. It is likely the strike will be the first in a line of industrial action.Purvinas said last-ditch negotiations between the ALAEA and Qantas before a {w|Fair Work Australia} judge yesterday had "hit a brick wall." Analysts say the strike will probably have a huge impact on Qantas flights. The airline said it was "extremely disappointed" at the strike action but said disruption would be minimal. "We will not be able to negotiate on some of the demands they have put forward, they are simply unacceptable," an airline spokesperson said.The ALAEA said the main concern was that Qantas was outsourcing more work overseas and maintenance checks on aircraft are becoming less regular. Pervinas said Qantas engineers were "sick of the systematic dismantling of our industry by Qantas management."== Sources ==

[[Wikinews interviews evicted London Metropolitan University occupier]]A group of students at {w|London Metropolitan University} who had been {w|sit in|occupying} the {w|Graduate student|graduate centre} at their university since the afternoon of Wednesday May 4 were evicted just before midnight on Monday by police, university security and private bailiffs.Wikinews, in contact with the occupiers, obtained a first-hand interview with one of the occupiers less than two hours after the occupation ended. The students staged the occupation in protest against cutbacks to courses at the university which, if enacted, would close 70% of the courses the university offers.John Hughes, 35, a {w|mature student} born in the {w|North London} borough of {w|Hackney} and living in {w|Brixton}, was one of over twenty students who were sleeping overnight in the university building. A second-year student in {w|sociology} and {w|international development}, one of the courses at risk, Hughes described the police intervention at around 11:40pm:As I came in the area we were occupying they came straight in the door...There was no warning. [...] We were served the injunction on the spot by two county court sheriffs, four police officers, ten bailiffs and one member of London Met security. We said, 'we need time to read this'. We were given ten minutes to read it and take our stuff.The occupiers have not had access to legal advice, although they have had "a bit of advice from some people who are not actually lawyers". The occupiers complain they were given no notice of the injunction and that it is inaccurate, naming at least one person "who hadn't committed trespass at all".The eviction also pre-empts an agreement, negotiated by London Metropolitan University Students' Union president Claire Locke, for LMU vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies to meet with the occupation on Tuesday morning. The occupiers feel certain now that Gillies' office made this agreement with the Students' Union and occupiers in bad faith, knowing that an injunction evicting the occupation would be served before then.The injunction follows a night after the occupation was itself invaded by members of a private security firm hired by the university management. In the early hours of Monday morning, occupiers say security staff kicked open the doors and entered an area where people were sleeping. Security personnel say an alarm was going off in the area; occupiers say there was no such alarm. Private security have also been sexually harassing and verbally intimidating the occupiers, Hughes alleges. "One of the members of the security team said through the doors to a young lady, 'you should put up a picture of yourself, something that's more sexy' and 'I'm quite a big bloke, and if I wanted to come into the occupation I would. Two young ladies are not going to stop me.'" Occupiers have also heard some racist comments from private security; the occupiers themselves are "a very mixed group" of all ages and ethnicities, "some from London, some from outside London, working class and some middle class."If the occupation had not been evicted, Hughes says they could have held out. "We had water, food and drinks for a while. I'm not sure for how long." Students at {w|Aberystwyth University} in Wales occupied two rooms at their university for over a month earlier this year.== Sources == 
[[Nothing honourable in honour killings, says Indian court]]India's {W|Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court} has labelled honour killings a "slur on the nation," and warned the death penalty will await those found guilty of the crime. The court finds "nothing honourable about honour killings."An independent study says each year an estimated 900 people are murdered in India for bringing dishonour to their families, usually by falling in love and marrying outside their caste or within their sub-caste. {w|Honour killing|Honour killings}, accepted as a cultural tradition in some parts of India, are normally punished with life imprisonment. But Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Misra have now called for a tougher stance, directing courts throughout India to use capital punishment in their sentencing."It is time to stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on the nation. This is necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilised behaviour. All persons who are planning to perpetrate honour killings should know that gallows await them," Justice Katju said.    The crack-down came yesterday, as the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal to lessen the life imprisonment of Bhagwan Dass. The man strangled his married daughter to death with wire after discovering she was in an incestuous affair. The Supreme Court also condemned the traditional village councils who endorse these honour killings and order them to be carried out.  == Sources ==

He had represented the constituency of {w|Greenock and Inverclyde|Greenock and Inverclyde} in Scotland since 2001 as a member of the {w|UK Labour party|Labour party}.Labour issued a statement saying "It is with great regret that we have to announce that David Cairns, member of parliament for Inverclyde, passed away at 2300 last night at the {W|Royal Free}, London. David had been suffering from acute pancreatitis after he was admitted as an emergency patient eight weeks ago. Our thoughts are with his partner Dermot, his father John and his brother Billy and all his many friends and family." The statement added "David's untimely death is a huge loss to parliament and politics in this country."Scottish {W|First Minster of Scotland|First Minister} Alex Salmond called Cairns ¡ª a former {W|Scotland Office} minister ¡ª "clearly a dedicated and principled parliamentarian, and an effective representative of his constituents, who carried respect across the political spectrum and far beyond." {W|Scottish Secretary} {W|Michael Moore|Michael Moore}, a {W|Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat}, said "David contributed a huge amount to Scottish political life and was a decent, intelligent and warm figure who was liked and respected across political divides."Cairns's {W|UK Conservative Party|Conservative} successor to the Scotland Office job said Cairns "was a truly decent man, who worked tirelessly for his constituents and for the interests of Scotland." Current Labour leader {w|Ed Miliband} also released a statement, saying "David will be missed beyond measure as a former minister, as an MP, as a friend and a colleague by many people." Former prime minister Tony Blair paid tribute to him by saying "David's life was dedicated to public service. He was a committed and conscientious constituency MP, an excellent government minister and a passionate campaigner for social justice, equality and opportunity."Cairns, who was a {W|Roman Catholic} priest before entering politics, was only allowed to become an MP when a new law was passed. Before 2001 a 19th-century law had stated that former Catholic priests were not allowed to stand as members of parliament. It was only when {w|The House of Commons Act 2001} was brought into force that he could stand for parliament. Cairns resigned during Gordon Brown's term as Prime Minister over disputes about Brown's position in 2008 but was re-elected at the last general election.Due to Cairns's death a {w|by-election} will have to be held to decide who will become his successor.
[[Ugandan parliament revisits Anti-Homosexuality Act]]Ugandan {w|Parliament of Uganda|Parliament} may take action on the {w|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act} this week.  It has reappeared for parliamentary debate for the first time since its proposal in 2009. The original bill called for making homosexuality punishable by imprisonment, or death in aggravated circumstances. Not reporting gay individuals to the government would also become a criminal act. Despite a great deal of international condemnation, the bill is largely supported in Uganda. One of the bills backers, {w|Martin Ssempa} told the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee that the death penalty is "something that we have moved away from," in recent hearings, according to the Associated Press. However, he stresses the importance of passing the bill, stating that "homosexuality is killing our society."
[[World Bank gives Kiribati emergency aid]]Kiribati, one of the world's most isolated nations, has received {w|USD|US$}2 million in emergency food aid from the World Bank. Lying on the equator, the {w|South Pacific} country hosts some of the least developed communities in the world, with few natural resources and relying heavily on imports.As the global food crisis pushes food prices through the roof, the people of this isolated region are struggling to cope, spending half of their income on food. The World Bank grant will provide emergency aid to 60,000 people, approximately 60 percent of the population.Little skilled workforce and being so geographically isolated has hindered the country's exports, with foreign aid and {w|tourism} each contributing one fifth of the area's finances. Kiribati's government and the World Bank struck the deal at the annual {w|Asian Development Bank} meeting in {w|Hanoi}, securing emergency food grants and developing programmes in environmental sustainability. This is the second recent grant to Kiribati from the World Bank following a US$20 million allowance given in March to devise applications to deal with the effects of {w|climate change}.  == Sources ==

The unnamed man, believed to be in his twenties and of a South Asian ethnicity, jumped from the 147th floor and landed on a decking area of the 108th floor. His death would be the first known suicide that has happened at the skyscraper¡ªcurrently the tallest in the world¡ªsince the building opened in January 2010.The owner of the building, {w|Emaar Properties}, released a statement saying that at 09:00 local time Tuesday, "an incident involving a male" was reported.

[[Campaigners angry at new British police tracking system]]Lawyers and campaigners have questioned whether innocent individuals may be tracked by the software, likened to a computer program in the {w|science fiction} film {w|Minority Report|Minority Report}. Sarah McSherry, a lawyer representing a number of protesters, raised fears officers could breach data protection laws by tracking innocent protesters, endangering the democratic rights of demonstrators. "We have already seen the utilisation of a number of tactics which infringe the right to peaceful protest, privacy and freedom of expression, assembly and movement. All of these have a chilling effect on participation in peaceful protest," she said. "This latest tool could also be used in a wholly invasive way and could fly in the face of the role of the police to facilitate rather than impede the activities of democratic protesters."Geotime correlates information from numerous sources allowing intelligence officers to view effectively every online move made by individuals, and its website says it can link one suspect to others. The computer software can reportedly create links between people and reveal relationships and private communications, disclosing "temporal patterns and behaviours." A product director at the parent company, {w|Oculus}, said the program is available to purchase commercially.A number of academics and intelligence experts have said the program could lead to more convictions in terrorism and organised crime investigations, with one professor describing its use as "absolutely right." In contrast, an official at {w|Privacy International} called on police to explain how the software would be used. "Once millions and millions of pieces of microdata are aggregated, you end up with this very high-resolution picture of somebody, and this is effectively what they are doing here," he said. "We shouldn't be tracked and traced and have pictures built by our own government and police for the benefit of commercial gain."Data protection in Britain has become a major issue among public debate in recent years. The most recent controversy to emerge came last week after an elderly man with no criminal record was given permission to take senior officers who systematically recorded details of his attendance at peaceful protests to the {w|High Court}. The Metropolitan Police have not yet confirmed how the computer system will be used, but they are researching numerous possibilities; a spokesperson said they were still assessing whether they would permanently use the technology but declined to confirm how much it cost.== Sources ==

[[Tasmanians protest against pulp mill]]Over 3000 protesters, dressed in black, marched the streets of {w|Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston}, Australia on Saturday to show their opposition to the construction of a pulp mill by {w|Gunns|Gunns Limited}. This follows the release of a survey, which showed that 40 percent of Tasmanians oppose the project. The mill has previously been opposed by the Launceston Environment Centre [LEC] and the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Medical Association [AMA], due to concerns about negative environmental and social impacts of liquid waste and air pollution. The LEC claims that there will be eight deaths per year from increased air pollution, and the AMA has already expressed concerns about Launcestons' current air quality, "Launceston has one of the worst air qualities within Australia," according to a written statement the AMA made in 2006. The statement also attacks the quality of modelling conducted by Gunns during the assessment of the mill. It says that {w|Particulates|anchor=Scale classification|PM2.5} scale particulates are "closely associated with the adverse health effects of particle air pollution", but were not measured in the assessment process. The pulp mill was green-lighted by environment minister {w|Tony Burke} in March, although no reassessments of air quality have been undertaken by Gunns. The company has stated that more work needs to be done to convince Tasmanians that air quality will not be reduced by the project.
[[Solar-powered airplane makes first international flight]]The solar-powered airplane {w|Solar Impulse} touched down at the {w|Brussels National Airport} late Friday night, after completing a 13-hour flight from its home base in {w|Payerne}, Switzerland. It was the first international flight by a fully solar-powered aircraft.The experimental aircraft was piloted by {w|Andr¨¦ Borschberg}, co-founder and chief engineer for the Solar Impulse project, which hopes to circumnavigate the globe using only the sun's energy in 2013. "Our goal is to create a revolution in the minds of people...to promote solar energies -- not necessarily a revolution in aviation," {w|Bertrand Piccard}, the group's other co-founder, said in an interview after the flight.The aircraft collects energy from the sun using 12,000 extremely thin solar cells affixed to the wings and tail section. An on-board battery can store enough electricity to fly all night, allowing the Solar Impulse to stay aloft indefinitely. This allowed the aircraft to maintain a holding pattern over the {w|Brussels Airport|Brussels airport} as other flights landed and conditions were right for the Solar Impulse to land. Because the aircraft weighs only about 3,500 pounds and has a wingspan of 200 feet, it is extremely sensitive to wind and needs calm conditions to land safely.== Sources == 
[[IMF head remains in New York prison; charged over alleged hotel sex attack]]{QuoteLeft|This sordid episode¡ªno matter how it ultimately plays out¡ªwill spell the end of Strauss-Kahn as an effective leader of the IMF even if he retains his position, which is highly unlikely.|source={{w|Eswar Shanker Prasad}, international economics professor, {w|Cornell University}}}Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, remained in jail last night after being charged with sexually attacking a chambermaid at a New York City hotel. Strauss-Kahn has agreed to undergo {w|forensic} screening before he appears in court, and has vowed to "vigorously" defend himself against the charges, which are likely to create a leadership void at the IMF, disrupt emergency talks over the {w|European debt crisis}, and spell the end of his political career.Strauss-Khan was the favourite candidate for the {w|president of France|French presidency}, and was expected to announce he would stand against Nicolas Sarkozy this month. But the allegations are expected to destroy the hopes of his supporters, increase infighting among the French left, and leave his political career in tatters. His arrest comes at a critical moment for the IMF, and will likely plunge efforts to stabilise the financial states of struggling {w|eurozone} countries into chaos. He was meant to discuss the bailouts of Greece and Portugal with European Union financial officials at a meeting in {w|Brussels} this week.Strauss-Kahn was to appear in court in {w|Manhattan} yesterday charged with three crimes, including {w|attempted rape}, but the hearing has been delayed so he can undergo forensic tests. He was taken into custody by officials while on an {w|Air France} passenger plane which was about to take off from {w|John F. Kennedy International Airport} for Paris; when detectives approached him in the {w|first class} cabin in the aircraft he reportedly asked: "What is this about?" Strauss-Kahn reportedly fled the hotel "in a hurry" after the attack, leaving a number of personal effects behind. "If our officers had been ten minutes later he would have been in the air and on their {sic} way to France," a spokesperson for the {w|New York Police Department} said.The chambermaid reported that she had been sexually assaulted by a man staying in a "luxury suite" at the {w|Sofitel New York Hotel|Sofitel} hotel near {w|Times Square}. "The maid described being forcibly attacked, locked in the room and sexually assaulted," the police spokesperson said. Strauss-Kahn came out of the shower naked while the chambermaid was working in the room, tried to pull the woman onto the bed and locked the door, {w|The New York Times} reported, quoting police sources. She allegedly fought him off, but he sexually assaulted her again after dragging her to the bathroom, before he locked her in the room; she was reportedly hospitalized afterwards with {w|trauma}.In 2008, a year after becoming the leader of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn was reprimanded by the organization's board after being involved in an {w|extramarital affair} with another senior executive at the bank. More recently, he was pictured driving a luxury car in Paris, causing a media furore over whether his lifestyle fitted with the {w|socialist} attitude he claims to represent. But his wife, former television star {w|Anne Sinclair}, has dismissed the accusations. She said: "I do not believe for one second the accusations brought against my husband.

The defence said Strauss-Kahn denied the charges against him and offered {w|USD|$}1,000,000 bail and said he would reside in Manhattan with an {w|electronic bracelet}, but the judge refused. Afterwards, defence lawyer Benjamin Brafman said: "This battle has just begun."The politician appeared in court charged with three crimes, including {w|attempted rape}, after a chambermaid told detectives she had been sexually assaulted by Strauss-Kahn in a luxury hotel near {w|Times Square}. "The maid described being forcibly attacked, locked in the room and sexually assaulted," a spokesperson for the {w|New York Police Department} said. Detectives said the politician was detained in the {w|first class} cabin of the passenger plane which was minutes from leaving for Paris. Strauss-Kahn had reportedly fled the hotel "in a hurry" after the attack, leaving a number of personal effects behind. Prosecutors have last night announced they are investigating claims made by a French author, {w|Tristane Banon}, that she was sexually assaulted by Strauss-Kahn in 2002. At the time, her mother¡ª{w|socialist} councillor {w|Anne Mansouret}¡ª persuaded her not to press charges against him, but yesterday she told French television that Strauss-Kahn had an "addiction" to "preying" on women, and had "a difficulty in controlling his impulses."

Arriving at the Garden of Remembrance shortly afterwards, she bowed her head stood for a {w|moment of silence} after laying a wreath to remember Irish republicans who fought for independence against British rule. The laying of the wreath is seen as a hugely symbolic moment in the first visit to the country by a British monarch since 1911, when {w|George V} travelled to Ireland while it was still part of the United Kingdom. While most of Ireland seems to support the visit by the head of the British monarchy, the military and the {w|Garda S¨ªoch¨¢na|Garda} have launched the largest security operation in the history of the country amid fears republican dissidents might launch an attack. More than 6,000 police and soldiers have been deployed in Dublin, and much of the city has been closed off. On Monday night, a bomb¡ªdescribed as "viable"¡ªwas found in the luggage compartment of a bus in {w|County Kildare}. All the passengers were evacuated from the bus and the Irish army later performed a {w|controlled explosion} on the device to make it safe. Police in London also warned on Monday they had received a bomb threat, which, according to sources, was from republican dissidents and was written in code.Hundreds of republican protesters opposed to the {w|Irish peace process|peace process} clashed with Garda on the streets of Dublin yesterday, throwing cans, bottles and {w|fireworks} at police lines. Riot officers fought off demonstrators throwing bricks, and 21 protesters were arrested. "Whatever the turnout the problem in Ireland has not gone away, namely the British presence in the north of our country," {w|Ruarai O'Bradaigh}, a prominent republican dissident and a former chief of staff at the IRA, said. "Resistance to that presence just like the presence of the English Queen will continue."The visit is to last four days, during which time Elizabeth is to visit {w|Croke Park}, a football stadium where British forces fired on football supporters in 1920 during the {w|Irish War of Independence}, killing 14 players and spectators. She is also to travel to {w|County Tipperary} to see the {w|Rock of Cashel} and will see the {w|Irish National Stud} in County Kildare. Although there have been small demonstrations, journalists in Ireland say the mood is largely supportive of the visit. "It was one small step for the Queen¡ªone huge moment in British-Irish history. It is 100 years since a British monarch has been in Ireland. Many thought a king or queen would never be welcomed back," {w|Mark Simpson}, a BBC reporter, said. "Whatever the security concerns, this has been a landmark moment in Dublin. In truth, it's one that most people living in Ireland today thought they would never see."== Sources ==

[[Police arrest train passenger for a 16-hour loud cellphone conversation]]A 39-year old woman, Lakeysha Beard, talked for more than half a day while on an {w|Amtrak} train going from {w|Oakland, California|Oakland}, California to {w|Portland, Oregon|Portland}, Oregon. The loud cellphone conversation lasted sixteen hours last Monday, after which police stopped the train for twenty minutes at {w|Salem, Oregon|Salem}, Oregon to arrest the woman.According to the {w|Daily Mail|British newspaper Daily Mail}, Amtrak has no policy forbidding passengers from talking on the phone on a moving train.In the train's  car, a few passengers asked the woman to put the phone away or to stop a few times during the conversation prior to notifying the train staff. Staff members were unable to convince the woman to end the conversation and stopped the train to arrest the woman and halt the disruption.As {w|Metro|British newspaper Metro} mentioned, this cellphone conversation doesn't beat the record 51-hour phone call by Sunil Prabhakar of New Delhi in 2009.Sydney, Australia etiquette expert Alex Travers, remarking on a train incident in March, said there is a lack of respect for public transportation from younger generations. The U.S. woman in the current incident, Lakeysha Beard, is 39 years old. Travers said, "I'm afraid we are all in a very bad place as far as we feel about our public transport.

[[Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigns as head of IMF]]Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned as the head of the International Monetary Fund after he was arrested and charged with sexually attacking a chambermaid at a hotel in New York. In a statement to the executive board of the IMF, he said he was resigning from his position "with immediate effect" to "devote all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my innocence." Officials at the IMF said they would soon be releasing information about his successor.In the statement to the board, he said it was "with infinite sadness" that he had to resign, and paid tribute to the IMF. "To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me," he said. The politician is currently being held at the notorious {w|Rikers Island}, where he has been put on {w|suicide watch}, after a judge at a court in {w|Manhattan} denied him {w|bail} for fears he was a flight risk after he reportedly tried to flee the country on a passenger jet. In court earlier this week, where Strauss-Kahn appeared tired, he denied the charges against him and offered {w|USD|$}1,000,000 bail, but the judge refused.Detectives said the politician was detained in the {w|first class} cabin of the {w|Air France} passenger plane which was minutes from leaving for Paris. Strauss-Kahn had reportedly fled the hotel "in a hurry" after the attack, leaving a number of personal effects behind. He was charged with committing a criminal sexual act, attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching.Investigators have this week continued to search the hotel room where the alleged attack took place, removing a piece of carpet in the suite which they hope will prove the allegation by the chambermaid that he forced her to have {w|oral sex}. Benjamin Brafman, the lawyer defending Strauss-Kahn, said {w|forensic evidence} found in the room at the {w|Sofitel New York} hotel "will not be consistent with a forcible encounter". Strauss-Kahn is to make another court appearance to plead for bail again this morning, Brafman said; the defence is reportedly considering telling the judge he will surrender his {w|passport}, wear an {w|electronic tag}, and remain under strict living conditions.The IMF has said it will soon release information about Strauss-Kahn's successor; {w|John Lipsky}, the deputy head, has been acting as head since the arrest at the weekend. The incident comes at a critical time for the IMF as it tries to the financial states of struggling {w|eurozone} countries. Strauss-Kahn was meant to discuss the bailouts of Greece and Portugal with European Union financial officials at a meeting in {w|Brussels} earlier this week. Before his arrest he was expected to announce his candicacy in the race for the {w|French presidency}, and analysts suggested he posed a real threat to Nicolas Sarkozy, but the charges will likely put and end to the hopes of his supporters.== Sources == 
[[Obama supports Middle East protesters in speech]]{QuoteLeft|Strategies of repression and diversion won¡¯t work anymore.|source=Barack Obama} U.S. president Barack Obama has put the support of his {w|Administration of Barack Obama|administration} behind {w|2010¨C2011 Middle East and North Africa protests|protesters demanding democracy} in the Middle East and {w|North Africa}, demanded Syrian president {w|Bashar al-Assad} embrace reforms or resign, and warned a failure to address the uprisings in the region could lead to deep division between the U.S. and Muslim nations.In a speech in Washington, D.C., Obama said it was a "historic opportunity" for his government to "promote reform, and to support transitions to democracy" in the region. Warning of "a deepening spiral of division between the United States and Muslim communities," he pledged to invest in a democratic future for Tunisia and Egypt, where protesters have overthrown dictators in the past few months. "Strategies of repression and diversion won¡¯t work anymore," he said, announcing a "new chapter" in Washington diplomacy.He also criticized the government of Bahrain for attacking peaceful protesters and conducting mass arrests. A crackdown on protesters, he said, "will not make legitimate calls for reform go away." Obama defended his decision to launch military action in Libya, saying "thousands would have been killed," and accused Muammar Gaddafi of launching "a war against his people, promising to hunt them down like rats." Gaddafi, he said, will "inevitably" leave or be forced from power.After imposing sanctions on Syria this week as military forces in the country clamp down on demonstrators in the capital, {w|Damascus}, Obama again condemned violence against peaceful protesters. He demanded the administration of president Assad stop shooting protesters and allow peaceful demonstrations, release {w|political prisoners}, and pass democratic reforms. "The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy," he said. Assad, he added, could either lead the transition or "get out of the way."Speaking at the {w|U.S. State Department}, Obama said he would react to the uprising in the region "in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security." He pledged to broaden the approach of his government beyond {w|counterterrorism} and ceasing the spread of nuclear weapons, to crack down on oppressive dictatorships which would harm U.S. interests. Unveiling a series of new economic initiatives intended to force out dictators, Obama pledged aid for Tunisia and Egypt to help them transform into democratic states.The speech is being seen by analysts as an attempt by Obama to reach out to Muslim communities abroad amid U.S. unpopularity. The president is also trying to convince his U.S. audience that the outcome of the {w|Arab Spring} will have an impact on the future of the U.S. and is worth spending money on during tumultuous economic times in Washington. The push for democracy began in January, as protesters in Tunisia overthrew president {w|Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali} in January. A month later, Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign from the Egyptian presidency. In Libya, demonstrators continue to try to topple Gaddafi, but have faced heavy bombardment from government forces.Obama also signaled that al-Qaeda is "losing its struggle for relevance" amid the uprising in the region, and said Osama bin Laden was rapidly losing followers before his death earlier this month. As the uprising spread, the agenda of the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks of September 11, 2001, was at a "dead end," he said. "Through the moral force of nonviolence, the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than terrorists have accomplished in decades."He called on Israel and Palestine to begin talks based on the {w|1967 borders} as the {w|Israeli¨CPalestinian conflict|conflict} stalls. "No peace can be imposed upon them, nor can endless delay make the problem go away," Obama said. "A lasting peace will involve two states for two peoples." But Israeli prime minister {w|Benjamin Netanyahu} tonight rejected the suggestion because it would endanger Israeli security.== Sources ==

[[Unrest spreads to Morocco; police violently break up demonstrations]]Pro-democracy protests by Moroccans in the capital of {w|Rabat} and city of {w|Casablanca} on Sunday were violently broken up by police. Protesters called for a reduction in the power of the monarchy, a strengthening of the power of the Prime Minister and a reformation of the judiciary.Police, armed with batons and shields, were seen violently beating protesters and chasing them away. The protesters in Casablanca chanted "[p]rotest is a legal right, why is the {w|Makhzen} afraid?" in reference to the royal court, and "Makhzen get out. Down with despotism." Others chanted "[w]e want our rights, even if we are condemned to death," before fleeing to avoid armed police.The police and the government were acting to try to stop a mass camp out protest similar to that seen earlier this year in Egypt's {w|Tahrir Square}, which eventually lead to the falling of the government.

[[Employees killed in Foxconn manufacturing factory]]On Friday evening, an explosion in {W|Chengdu}, China caused partial shutdown of a facility operated by {W|Foxconn}, one of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers and a major supplier to companies like Hewlett-Packard, {W|Dell}, Sony, Apple, {W|Motorola} and Nokia. Initial investigations now suggest the explosion was caused by poor ventilation, which lead to high concentrations of combustible dust.The blast happened at 7:18PM, around the time workers change shifts. A fire followed. Emergency services had control by 7:30PM. At least three people were killed, at least fifteen injured. Foxconn halted production to investigate, saying "All operations at the affected workshop remain suspended and production at all other workshops that carry out similar processing functions have also been halted pending the results of the investigation. All other production operations in our facilities in China continue operating normally."On Monday, city officials gave the cause as combustible dust in the air at a polishing workshop. Hong Kong-based labor rights group Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior said they reported aluminium dust problems in March when they reviewed working conditions at Foxconn. After the explosion, they commented that workers were complaining "the ventilation of the department is poor. Workers polish the {W|iPad} cases to make them shiny. In the process, there is lots of aluminum dust floating in the air. Workers always breathe in aluminum dust even though they put on masks. When workers take off their cotton gloves, their hands are covered with aluminum dust."Foxconn responded by saying the group was trying  to "capitalize on the tragic accident" and misrepresented "Foxconn's commitment to the health and safety of our employees."Foxconn is responsible for making iPads and {W|iPhones} for Apple. Research group IHS iSuppli said the explosion may cause loss of production of 500,000 iPads during this quarter of the year. They said there is a larger facility in {W|Shenzhen}, but it cannot cope with re-compensating the possible loss.== Sources == 
[[London policeman charged over G20 protest death]]An officer with London's {W|Metropolitan Police} has been charged with causing the death of a man caught up in the {W|2009 G-20 London summit protests|G20 protests} in 2009. PC Simon Harwood is accused of the manslaughter of {W|Ian Tomlinson}, who died after Harwood hit him with a baton before pushing him to the ground.Homeless paper-seller Tomlinson was pushed from behind outside the {W|Bank of England} as he walked back from work. He died within minutes. The death was filmed and attracted international media attention. Last year, {W|Keir Starmer}, Director of Public Prosecutions for {W|England and Wales}, announced that no charges would be brought due to conflicting medical evidence. That decision was placed under review after an inquest jury ruled last month that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed.Starmer met with the Tomlinson family today, informing them of his changed decision before the {W|Crown Prosecution Service} released a statement by him. In it, he explained that the inquest evidence had changed his position.He named two areas in which the inquest has had an impact: One is extra medical evidence and the other is questioning in court to assess conflicting medical evidence from different sources. "But for the inquest, the significant conflicts in the evidence that had previously existed could not have been addressed; and the inquest process, which is less confined than a criminal trial, has allowed a degree of clarity to emerge," said Starmer.He adds that "the position in relation to the medical evidence about the cause of death has clearly changed," although he cautioned that the prosecution will remain difficult owing to conflicting medical evidence. Starmer continued, saying that "it is clearly in the public interest that criminal proceedings be brought. Accordingly, a summons charging PC Harwood with the manslaughter of Mr Tomlinson has been obtained .... He will appear before [City of Westminster Magistrates' Court] on 20 June 2011."== Sources == 
[[NATO intensifies attack on Libya]]In the ongoing attempt to force Muammar Gaddafi from power, NATO aircraft struck at least 15 targets in central Tripoli early yesterday morning.Libyan state TV station {W|Jamahiriya} says nineteen people are dead and 150 more are wounded in what was the largest NATO bombing of Libya yet. The strike lasted 30 minutes and targeted a military facility that had been used to attack civilians, according to a NATO official who spoke with Reuters.The bombings are part of the U.S. initiative to remove Gaddafi from power, which has since been taken over by NATO. The campaign to halt Gaddafi's 41-year rule of Libya began in response to violent action taken against a public uprising in March. The United Nations approved the NATO bombing campaign to protect Libyan citizens in the civil war.  While the air strikes on the current Libyan regime are being increased, the rebels accepted the U.S. invitation yesterday to open an office in Washington. This does not indicate formal recognition, but it may indicate that the U.S. is following the lead of France and other countries in partnering with the Libyan opposition.Despite the rebel forces possessing much of eastern Libya and the intensifying attacks on Gaddafi's government, no breakthrough seems imminent in the battle for power, according to the {W|The New York Times}.Gaddafi scoffs at NATO's attacks, claiming he is untouchable as he "lives in the hearts of millions".== Sources ==

[[Paraguayan ambassador to Chile visits Pichilemu hacienda after 'slavery' controversy]]Paraguayan Ambassador to Chile Terumi Matsuo visited Pichilemu as a denouncement of trafficking of persons from Paraguay in the Pichileminian hacienda of {w|San Antonio de Petrel}, currently property of politician {w|Francisco Javier Err¨¢zuriz Talavera}, prompted an investigation. The investigation is being conducted by the Government of Cardenal Caro Province, and the Immigration Department of the {w|Investigations Police of Chile}. Err¨¢zuriz Talavera is also known by its nickname, Fra Fra.Paraguayan media was the first to report that a 'slavery regime' was taking place in the former presidential candidate's hacienda, after former workers 'managed to escape' from there. According to {w|Pichilemu News}, it was reported that the workers "were only given one meal daily, and salty water," and "[Err¨¢zuriz] had promised to give them 750US$, about 350,000 Chilean pesos as salary." Pichilemu News also reported that at least 150 persons were victims of the 'slavery regime', as it has been called by the Paraguayan media.Matsuo arrived at Pichilemu at 11:00 local time on Saturday, and after reuniting with the {w|governor of Cardenal Caro} {w|Julio Ibarra Maldonado}, both went to the Caba?as Santa Irene, where the affected Paraguayans were staying. According to Jorge Nasser's Radio Entre Olas, the ambassador "invited the workers to the [Pichilemu] municipal gymnasium for a meeting, in order to coordinate the actions to get them back to their country of origin or, as some have preferred, to stay in Chile.""Nothing surprises me of Mr. Err¨¢zuriz, I think the whole country is tired of him too. This man believes he's the owner of Chile, [he's just the] owner of a farm, I think it's not worth it to respond him. But I assure you we are going to fiscalize everything that needs to be fiscalized," Minister of Labor and Social Providence {w|Evelyn Matthei} told Radio Universo on Tuesday. According to Matthei, "six Paraguayans and one Brazilian" were found at the Petrel hacienda, "working without a contract and without proof of payment." "It's totally and absolutely unacceptable to bring undocumented workers [here], to have them working without a contract and to not know if they have been paid or not. We aren't going to accept that," Matthei added.In response to actions taken by the Chilean government, Francisco Javier Err¨¢zuriz wrote an open letter on Tuesday which he sent to several media outlets in Chile, titled "A la ministra {w|Evelyn Matthei} y a los chilenos". "Matthei argues that the Ministry of Interior has denied that I knew the income situation of the Paraguayans, in circumstances that I have stamped letters from that ministry [which would demonstrate] they always helped to facilitate the arrival of those citizens from a sister nation, which then would be hired and may assist in the development of Chile, [I was] even recommended that the Ministry of Interior would give them the MERCOSUR visa, because it's quicker, and [they] instructed that way the Governor of Pichilemu [sic]," Err¨¢zuriz said in the letter. Err¨¢zuriz also accused Matthei of being racist towards immigrants: "The Labor Minister does not want immigrants to work in Chile to strengthen our motherland. [She] demonstrates with that that her roots aren't found here ¡ªbut in the origin country of her family¡ª, which isn't Chile, and that she as descendant of German immigrants, the '{w|jus sanguinis}' prevails over the '{w|jus soli}'."The Labor Department fined more than 14,000,000{w|Chilean peso|CLP} to the company of Francisco Javier Err¨¢zuriz, Frutales y Vi?edos Err¨¢zuriz Ovalle, on Thursday. Mar¨ªa Cecilia S¨¢nchez, Director of Labor, said "the situation is being investigated by the Prosecution Office [Fiscal¨ªa]," and that "26 persons who were working at Err¨¢zuriz's company were brought back to their origin countries [Brazil and Paraguay], and other 46 are staying at {w|caba?a|caba?as} in Pichilemu." S¨¢nchez added that "[an investigation] needs to be consolidated on what happens in another Francisco Javier Err¨¢zuriz's company, Bosques de la Costa S.A."On Friday, Minister Matthei reunited with Paraguayan Ambassador Matsuo, "who thanked the government efforts to clarify the laboral abuses," {w|El Mercurio} reported. "This is a laboral case that ashames us as a country. It really ashames that something like this occurs in Chile," Matthei said. "This is one of the worst things I have seen and what actually happens is that it ashames," she added. Matthei also said Francisco Javier Err¨¢zuriz would not be paying anything to the Paraguayans because "they have to pay him firstly, because he brought them [to Chile], and according to himself he trained them."
[[UN accuses Australia of 'demonising asylum seekers']]The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has questioned Australia's tough asylum seeker policies this week, stating that Australia's mandatory detention regime has "cast a shadow" over its human rights record. {W|Navi Pillay}, the UN's Human Rights watchdog, was particularly critical of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's asylum seeker trade deal with Malaysia.This bilateral agreement, if signed, would see 800 refugees attempting to get to Australia by boat immediately transported to Malaysia instead. In return, Australia would take 4,000 genuine refugees from Malaysia over a space of four years. However, Malaysia has not signed either the international Refugee Convention, or the Convention Against Torture.   In an interview with the ABC, Ms Pillay voiced concern over this, stating that Australia may "violate refugee law" by sending asylum seekers to a country where no laws are in place to protect them.Pillay, a South African former anti-apartheid protester, also voiced distress over the omnipresence of political "demonising" of these asylum seekers stating, "[t]he consequence of the constant political refrain that Australia is being 'flooded' by people who are 'queue jumpers' has resulted in a stigmatisation of an entire group of people, irrespective of where they have come from or what dangers they have fled".In her six-day trip to Australia, the UN Human Rights Commissioner visited two detention centres and said she was overwhelmed with the "grim despondency" of asylum seekers, many of whom wait over 18 months to have their case assessed.The mistreatment of refugees was today reinforced with the release of an Australian Rights Commission report, which revealed extensive problems of self-harm and depression among detainees at the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney.== Sources ==

Pentagon spokesperson David Lapan said that official sources from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad requested a scaling down of the American training force, which is estimated to be composed of between 120 and 300 troops, on Wednesday."We were recently notified in writing that the government of Pakistan wished for the US to reduce its footprint in Pakistan. Accordingly, we have begun those reductions."The majority of the US presence in question is comprised of Special Forces troops, who train, prepare and give advice to Pakistani soldiers as part of a wider effort to counter Islamist fighter and terrorist groups, such as {w|al-Qaeda}. Mr. Lapan did not specify exactly how many troops would be leaving, though unnamed military sources have said that the total force will number around 50 after the reduction.The impending withdrawal of troops highlights the tensions between the US and Pakistan in the wake of the American raid on bin Laden¡¯s Abbottabad home, resulting in the death of America's most wanted terrorist.  Prior to this announcement, concerns within Pakistan have been raised about whether the attack violated Pakistan's sovereignty, and some lawmakers have called for a review of Pakistani¨CUS relations.In the days following the raid Pakistan's army chief, General {W|Ashfaq Kayani}, said that any comparable raids in Pakistan in the future would lead to a re-evaluation of the nation's military and political collaboration with the US. He also told his commanders of the desire to have the numbers of American troops in Pakistan be brought down to "the minimum level."== Sources == 
[[US Military to Partially Pull out from Pakistan]]I find the burn-out and disenchantment rate among Wikinews users to be alarmingly high. Two very productive editors responsible for most of our output in past months, {user|Yurtletturtle} and {user|Mattisse}, have effectively left the project, citing internal problems.It should be clear now, to everyone, that the project is not working in its current form and cannot achieve its ultimate goal of providing reliable, popular, and comprehensive news with the current implementation. The project has been in a slump for the past seven months, and small spikes of activity have failed to get anywhere. A glance at statistics shows that Wikinews has been on a continuous downward track since 2007.This statement is not intended to provoke controversy or drama. It is a call to action. We must start actively working to make the project more appealing to contributors if we wish to make a name for ourselves in the world of journalism.I fear we are heading down the same path as Nupedia. Wikipedia was once just a section of Nupedia without the latter's bureaucratic, overly strict approval process. Look where both projects are now. I believe we can achieve, although maybe not Wikipedia's exponential growth, at least a noticeable rise in output and quality by implementing the peer-review changes proposed elsewhere. Large review waits are one of the biggest hurdles for new contributors and a very common reason for burn-out. In addition, the lengthy waits also mean we are perpetually stuck "behind the curve" in timely news reporting compared to other news outlets.Also, I'd like to offer a small essay I wrote yesterday for the community's consideration.Please, let's discuss changes actively and get things moving. Let's put aside our differences, find common ground, ignore irrelevant drama, and work towards the common goal. It would pain me to see Wikinews slide into obscurity. Tempodivalse 
[[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|[talk]]] 19:14, 29 March 2011--Ashershow1talk 22:09, 29 March 2011 Hello.  Please be advised that personal attacks of any kind are not acceptable on Wikinews.  This is your only warning.  Any further misconduct towards another user will result in an immediate block from all editing until further notice.  Thank you. {-} --Ashershow1talk 00:38, 30 March 2011First offenses and isolated incidents Sometimes the best way to respond to an isolated personal attack is not to respond at all. Wikipedia and its debates can become stressful for some editors, who may occasionally overreact. Additionally, Wikipedia discussions are in a text-only medium that conveys nuances and emotions poorly; this can easily lead to misunderstanding. While personal attacks are not excused because of these factors, editors are encouraged to disregard angry and ill-mannered postings of others when it is reasonable to do so, and to continue to focus their efforts on improving and developing the encyclopedia.If you feel that a response is necessary and desirable, you should leave a polite message on the other user's talk page.  Do not respond on a talk page of an article; this tends to escalate matters. Likewise, it is important to avoid becoming hostile and confrontational yourself, even in the face of abuse.  Although templates have been used at times for this purpose, a customized message relating to the specific situation is often better received.  When possible, try to find compromise or common ground regarding the underlying issues of content, rather than argue about behavior.Personal attacks do not include civil language used to describe an editor's actions, and when made without involving their personal character, should not be construed as personal attacks, for instance, stating "Your statement is a personal attack..." is not itself a personal attack. Attacks that are particularly offensive or disruptive should not be ignored.  Extraordinary situations that require immediate intervention are rare, but may be reported on the administrators' noticeboard. Mattisse 02:43, 30 March 2011As a tentative draft, I've come up with this. It's nowhere near done yet, but what does everyone think about the general gist? I feel this is a good first step towards defining personal attacks and enforcement. Tempodivalse 
[[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|[talk]]] 03:24, 30 March 2011A personal attack of any kind towards a fellow Wikinewsie will result in single warning on the offender's talk page.  Any further personal attacks after the warning will result in an immediate 24-hour block.  If the personal attacks are continued after the block is over, the user will be reviewed as a candidate for permanent block.  This rule applies to all users regardless of seniority.Votes:First, I'll reiterate some points Tempo will have missed since xe was absent during the many months of discussion on this subject on the policy water cooler late last year.Now, a different point.  You're addressing something that isn't the problem.  It's not even possible ¡ªtempting, but not honestly possible¡ª to claim that the problem is Wikipedians coming here and assuming bad faith on the part of Wikinewsies, because even though that does happen a lot, it too is a symptom.  I don't pretend to have successfully isolated what the problem is yet, but consider this:--Pi zero 16:26, 30 March 2011You've no need to live in a slum to appreciate that swearing is commonplace. I will admit that is not a particularly nice way to highlight that the use of profanity is far more widespread than your life experience shows. But, don't you "own" 90%+ of the discussion on this page? Would your Wikinews time not be better spent trying what you think everyone else should do? Then you will, at least here, see why people never reach a consensus on your proposals. You may, after doing so, be more qualified to start a discussion than a devisive vote. --Brian McNeil / talk 18:42, 30 March 2011At this point in the conversation, I'd like to reiterate something that I said when this was being discussed months ago: Wikipedia has a large number of policies detailing what type of interactions users are allowed to have with each other, and how they're allowed to have them. But ¡ª as was brought up on Wikimedia Strategic Planning ¡ª Wikipedia is still rife with blatant meanness, sexism, racism, and general intolerance. Creating policies that ban certain words and dictate the language that people are allowed to use stopped absolutely NONE of that. It did nothing. It continues to do nothing. A significant part of the Strategic Planning process was devoted to various people trying to come up with solutions to the fact that Wikipedia has failed so utterly and completely to create an acceptable working environment.So I ask you all to consider this: why should we copy their failed strategies? Creating policy pages saying "don't be racist" or "don't be a bigot" doesn't work; if it did, Wikipedia would be an awesome place of awesome awesomeness ;).In my opinion we should have exactly one policy page dealing with etiquette/behaviour/disputes. It should say very little, because if Wikipedia has taught us one thing, it's that red tape is useless for dealing with this type of thing. It should say something like this, in a few short paragraphs and with a few bullet points:There are perhaps 2 or three other points it could touch on, but it should be kept brief. There should also be a certain... vagueness to it. It is fundamentally impossible for us to create a detailed policy that will cover every situation. The best alternative to that is to create vague, generalized principles that can be broadly applied to any situation. Gopher65talk 00:35, 5 May 2011The review queue being substantially slow, it came to my mind to split it into 'preliminary review' and 'full review' queues. The former would check general verifiability, copyright, newsworthiness, while the latter could focus on the style and NPOV. Do you think this would make the reviewing process easier? Gryllida 02:32, 9 May 2011anyone know where to find this?

Although it seems our category names mostly omit accents, I was readily able to come up with a more extreme example: :Category:S?o Tom¨¦ and Pr¨ªncipe. --Pi zero 17:46, 19 May 2011I suggest moving these from mainspace to portal space and marking them historical.  They're a different sort of creature than the notion of article that has come into sharper focus since they were maintained, so don't seem right for mainspace; and they are data, so don't seem right for project space.  They should go somewhere with flaggedrevs enabled.  The historical tags can, of course, be removed later if the effort is resurrected.  --Pi zero 13:59, 25 May 2011I expect most of you have seen me clogging recent changes with minor edits to User:Dendodge/Main_Page¡ªit's my working draft of a redesigned Main Page. We're overdue a redesign, IMO. I don't intend to change the layout too much, but the finished version will be cool in a number of ways:I would like some input¡ªmuch like the previous Main Page redesign project, it would be nice to make this a collaborative thing, and incorporate elements from each design. I'd also like some comments on the feasibility¡ªand, indeed, wisdom¡ªof a modular main page.The idea of that is that people can pick the "world" leads, or leads specific to a certain country, or regarding a certain topic, or a combination thereof, and what they want to have in their DPL, and what they want in the boxes at the bottom.Obviously, this will mean¡ªif the community likes the idea, that is¡ªgetting portals working, and getting somebody willing to work for kudos and barnstars to get the infrastructure in place.This is all just a concept at the moment, though, and the main page redesign can¡ªand should, IMHO¡ªgo ahead even if we decide to make it static. Now, everyone dissect my comments and tell me how stupid I'm being! DENDODGE 14:37, 21 April 2011OMG. I was working a redesign, too! We should have a contest. My design involves some tweaked javascript, so I can't do anything with it on WN yet, but it's currently at here. ¡ªfetch¡¤comms 15:57, 21 April 2011While we're still in the discussion stage, I think it would be a good idea to discuss how to actually choose the next main page design. There are currently two proposals: mine and Dendodge's. Obviously, we should be continuing to discuss these ideas, proposing new designs, etc., but I'm wondering whether the community supports:The last one makes more sense to me, because rarely does a single design work by itself, but if the community would prefer a competition or other format of selection, that's fine with me. ¡ªfetch¡¤comms 17:55, 21 April 2011MC8, if you mean static and broke as "not updated", then that's just because it's a hardcoded mockup that I've had to stick on Wikia due to some js tweaks I've had to make. No images on Wikia, I'm afraid, but everything should update fine on WN with DPL. But if you mean broke as in "the formatting" is a complete fail", then make sure you're looking at it in Vector with js enabled. If it's still weird, blame it on some hacky coding I need to fix and look at this screenshot instead: . ¡ªfetch¡¤comms 02:41, 23 April 2011What Amgine said. A contest wouldn't truly rate design skills of the community, while a friendly discussion could allow to make a decision in a more reliable, calm way when everyone more or less supports the outcome. Of the three proposals, I seem to actually like the "centralised discussion" idea, but the other two probably won't work very well. Gryllida 06:30, 23 April 2011I like the idea of buttons, the rounded cornerness, and the geographical focus of fetchcomms' design. I don't like the ticker, but that's because I don't like news tickers in general. They're too distracting in my view. I like the colour scheme, top title bar, and parts of the general layout of Dendodge's page. I'd suggest merging some more of the ideas from the two of them together. Gopher65talk 00:13, 5 May 2011This should be taken into account and the design done with this as a goal. --Brian McNeil / talk 15:07, 25 May 2011As things are now set up, sister links from an article go in the "External links" section.  Of course they can't properly go in the "Sources" section, but it really grates on me to relegate our esteemed sister projects to externality.  So I propose a separate optional section called "Sister links", to go after "Sources" and before optional "External links".To make this work well, I suggest we use a different format than the large right-floating boxes like {tl|Wikipedia}.  If there's a section devoted to these links, they should be on the left, and more compact.  I envision something akin to the following; there would still be at least three details to settle. -------- Details to settle:--Pi zero 15:20, 4 May 2011Ideally, our article format would be revamped so such a "related links"-type section would be seamlessly integrated with the rest of the page. ¡ªfetch¡¤comms 02:37, 9 May 2011My question is this, why do reporterswhen covering a news item tend to jazz it up so that it will attract the interest of the general public.

[[Water main bursts in west Edinburgh; traffic, utilities disrupted]]In Edinburgh, capital of Scotland, part of an underground water piping system has exploded, forcing local residents to be evacuated. The pipe broke around 03:30 {w|British Summer Time|BST} today, within Allan Park Road, causing flooding in the Slateford area of the city.A spokesperson for Scottish sewerage and water corporation {w|Scottish Water} explained: "Early this morning reports were received of flooding in Allan Park Road and Scottish Water operatives attended the scene. A large diameter water main had burst. The water was shut off and re-routed via other pipes to keep supplies flowing to households in the area. Repairs are under way and the customers affected by the flooding are being offered assistance."Stating that repairs to resolve this problem had commenced and would take a few hours to conclude, {w|Lothian and Borders Police} have advised that the floods may disrupt the supplies of water and other utilities, as well as transportation on roads and railways in the west of Edinburgh. Hospitals and rest homes in the region have been notified of the incident and bottled water is now anticipated to be supplied at these buildings.According to local residents, Slateford Road, a major throughway, was closed for several hours this morning. Telephony and broadband in the area is disrupted, with local residents and businesses having to rely on cellphones. Further work, such as digging up the road and using temporary traffic lights, will be required to restore these services in the area.As of 13:15 BST, Scottish Water has excavated around the burst main, but has not yet begun work on replacing the damaged section of pipe.== Sources == 
[[Brazilian surfer wins world championship in Pichilemu, Chile]]The fourteenth {w|Quiksilver} Ceremonial {w|Punta de Lobos} Big Wave Invitational surf championship took place on Saturday in the Chilean city of Pichilemu, often called the "Capital of the Surf." In this year's competition, 24 surfers from countries such as South Africa, Peru, Chile, the United States, and Argentina participated in the championship, including Pichileminians Ram¨®n Navarro and Cristian Merell¨®, and Hawaiian K?hl Christensen. The surfers competed for a {w|US$}20,000 prize.The Quiksilver Ceremonial Punta de Lobos has been a tradition since 1998. Christensen won that championship, and has regularly participated in it since then, according to {w|La Tercera}. "If [the Chilean waves] weren't that good, I wouldn't come back. They're powerful, that's what makes of Chile a great place to train," Christensen told La Tercera.The competition was scheduled to take place sometime between April 1 and May 31; it was confirmed to take place on May 28 by Gary Linden, the Big Wave World Tour Contest Director. "We are excited to kick off the 2011 Big Wave World Tour with the third annual Quiksilver Ceremonial. [...] It looks like patience is going to pay off as we are expecting surf in the 30 to 40 foot range with light winds and good lighting making for the perfect start to season," Linden said."The Quiksilver Ceremonial is one of the world's most anticipated big wave events, featuring some of the best waves and skilled surfers from around the globe," Hawaiian media Aloha Update reported. Carlos Ferrer, marketing manager of Quiksilver Chile, said: "This championship has managed to put itself as one of the great dates of the worldwide surfing scene. It is of international class."On Thursday, Mayor of Pichilemu Roberto C¨®rdova reunited with organizers of the ceremonial,  Carlos Ferrer, Gary Linden, and Ricardo Parot from Wetfly Productions, at the {w|Pichilemu city hall}. "The mayor reiterates his commitment to the community with these kinds of events in the low-season as they are great attractions that help support Pichilemu's tourism industry," city hall representatives said on its Facebook profile.Many people visited Punta de Lobos on Friday, as the surfers were practicing. "There was great expectation in Punta de Lobos yesterday [on Friday]," La Tercera reported. "It has arrived the same amount of people coming a long holiday weekend to Pichilemu, but this time, only to see the championship," director of surf magazine Glass.cl Rodrigo Far¨ªas told the newspaper. Far¨ªas also told La Tercera that during last year's ceremonial there were waves eight-meters high, and "[Saturday]'s waves are expected to be more ordained." He predicted that it would be "a bit cloudy, and there will be more time between one wave and another, so there could be more tubes, which will be much better visually."The surfers dropped into the sea to begin the championship at 07:30 local time. It is estimated that least two thousand people from Chile and other countries attended the event throughout the day. A helicopter flew overhead at Punta de Lobos, recording and photographing the surfers and attendants. The attendants were given free fruit juice, fruits, as well as {w|Red Bull} drinks at the end of the day.The 24 competing surfers were: K?hl Christensen, Carlos Burle, Marcos Monteiro, Peter Mel, Chris Bertish, Ram¨®n Navarro, Diego Medina, Cristian Merello, Rusty Long, Grant "Twiggy" Baker, Fernando Zegers, Reinaldo Ibarra, Greg Long, Gabriel Villar¨¢n, Jamie Sterling, Anthony Taschnick, Mark Healey, Kealii Mamala, Jaimie Mitchell, Danilo Couto, Sebastian de Romana, Le¨®n Vicu?a, and Mat¨ªas L¨®pez.The Quiksilver Ceremonial Punta de Lobos was broadcasted live in HD quality for the first time in the championship's history through its official website. The footage included underwater shots.The championship lasted until 17:30 local time, and the results were as follows: "Viva Brazil! Firstly I want to thank God, because everyone's okay and nobody got injured. I also want to thank the residents of Pichilemu for giving us good vibes and to the jet-skis pilots, who worked hard all day. I knew this day was going to come," Marcos Monteiro, the winning surfer said shortly after the championship ended during a press conference.The Big World Tour's next stop is {w|Pico Alto}, Peru, on July 1.

[[Egypt opens border crossing with Gaza]]Egyptian authorities reopened the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip on Saturday, allowing Palestinians unrestricted access out of the Strip for the first time since June 2007.The opening of the crossing was one of the conditions of a peace agreement that Egypt and Palestinian political groups Hamas and {w|Fatah} agreed to last month. Under the new crossing rules, all Palestinian citizens except men between the ages of eighteen and forty will be able to pass through the border unrestricted, while men in that age range will have to possess a visa in order to enter Egypt.  All people crossing the border are also required to have a Palestinian ID card. The crossing will be open daily except Fridays and holidays from 0900 to 2100 local time.The last time there was an open crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt was prior to June 2007, when Hamas gained control of Gaza, and Egypt and Israel closed their borders in response. Since then, only about 300 people have been allowed through the Egyptian border each day, usually those in need of medical facilities and students.The crossing will allow only people through; no commercial traffic will be permitted and everyone who passes through will be searched.Israel has raised concerns about the opening of the border, claiming that weapons will be smuggled through. The country's vice prime minister, Silvan Shalom said that the opening of the border "is a dangerous development that could lead to weapons and al-Qaida smuggling in Gaza."A spokesperson from Hamas called the opening of the crossing "a courageous and responsible decision which falls in line with Palestinian and Egyptian public opinion." He said that Hamas hopes "it is a step towards the complete lifting of the siege on Gaza."An Egyptian government spokesperson, Menha Bakhoum, said that the decision to open the crossing was made in order to "ease the suffering of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip."

[[Atlanta Thrashers sold to True North Sports and Entertainment, moving to Winnipeg]]Fifteen years after the {w|Winnipeg Jets} left the province of Manitoba, Canada, an announcement on Tuesday made official what ice hockey fans have been anticipating: The {w|National Hockey League}'s {w|Atlanta Thrashers} are moving to {w|Winnipeg}. The Thrashers, who have been a target for relocation rumors amid the ownership struggles and financial losses, will leave Atlanta after eleven seasons there in the highest-level professional ice hockey league in North America. The deal, which was finalized early in the morning Tuesday, has just one step to climb: a vote by the NHL's Board of Governors, which will take up the matter at their June 21 meeting.The city of Winnipeg, which has been ready and waiting for an NHL franchise since the Jets relocated to {w|Glendale, Arizona|Glendale}, Arizona and became the {w|Phoenix Coyotes} in 1996, is already host to a team in the second-tier {w|American Hockey League}, the {w|Manitoba Moose}. During the announcement Tuesday, True North stated that they were starting a season ticket drive. They also announced that they have yet to choose a name for the new team.The Thrashers are not the first franchise that True North has set its sights on in regards to acquiring an NHL team. The Coyotes, which have been owned by the league since the previous owners filed for bankruptcy in 2009, was highly sought-after by True North in the past few years in an attempt to literally "return the Jets to Winnipeg". In early May, the Glendale City Council approved a measure to pay $25 million to the league, to cover their operating expenses for the next year in order to keep the team in the city.This is not the first time an NHL franchise has been relocated north of the border from the #8-ranked media market in the United States; in 1980, the {w|Atlanta Flames} moved to {w|Calgary}, Alberta, becoming the {w|Calgary Flames}. Atlanta was later granted an expansion franchise in 1997, and the Thrashers took the ice to start the 1999-00 NHL season. In the 11 seasons the Thrashers spent in Atlanta, they made the playoffs only once; in the 2006-07 season, they reached the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, where they were swept in the best-of-seven series by the {w|New York Rangers} in four straight games.

Endeavour launched earlier this month on a mission to carry the {w|Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer} and several spare parts to the International Space Station. The AMS will enable scientists to examine {w|cosmic rays} and learn more about the history of the {w|universe}.The six-member crew of STS-134 consists of commander {w|Mark Kelly|Mark Kelly}, pilot {w|Gregory H.

Giffords watched the launch from the Kennedy Space Center on May 16, but was asleep in a hospital during the early morning landing, according to Kelly.The end of the shuttle program comes after NASA opted to phase out the aging fleet, which has been in use since 1981, due to financial problems with maintaining the crafts. According to {w|BBC News Online}, NASA thinks that allowing private businesses to win space transportation contracts will generate enough revenue to pay for sending astronauts to and from the International Space Station. {HYS question left|Is ending the Space Shuttle program a good decision in the long term?}In a statement, {w|Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA Administrator} {w|Charles F. Bolden, Jr.}, said, "We are very proud of Endeavour's legacy, and this penultimate flight of the space shuttle program once again demonstrated the amazing skill and dedication of our astronauts and the entire workforce." He stated that as NASA "begin[s] the transition from the shuttle program to the commercial transportation of [its] crews and cargo, [its] ability to tackle big challenges remains steadfast and will ensure that NASA reaches even more destinations farther in the Solar System."Space Shuttle Endeavour began service after the {w|Space Shuttle Challenger} {w|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|exploded} shortly after lifting off in 1986; all seven astronauts aboard died as a result of the disaster. Endeavour launched on its maiden flight, {w|STS-49}, in May 1992. During her career, Endeavour has orbited the planet 4,671 times, spent 299 days in space, and transported a total of 170 astronauts. The vehicle has traveled a total distance longer than 197.6 million kilometres. While in space, NASA's Michael Fincke set a space endurance record, spending the longest total time of any American in space at 382 days. STS-134 was Fincke's third spaceflight and first on the Space Shuttle. The spaceflight was the 25th and final flight of Endeavour, as well as the 134th and second-to-last of the entire {w|Space Shuttle Program}.During the crew's stay at the ISS, the crew completed the final four {w|extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks} scheduled to be performed by Space Shuttle crews. During these spacewalks, the crew installed components to the exterior of the station. Space Shuttle crews performed a total of 164 spacewalks, 159 of which contributed to the maintenance and completion of the International Space Station. Preparations are currently underway for Endeavour to go on public display in Los Angeles, California.The final mission in the Space Shuttle program, {w|STS-135}, is scheduled to launch on July 8.

According to {w|BBC News Online}, the attack is thought to be the largest in the history of the Internet.
[[Gay couple elected prom king and queen in Maine's Sanford High School]]Although prom may have taken place over two weeks ago at Maine's {w|Sanford High School}, the fact that students elected a {w|Homosexuality|gay couple} as {w|prom} king and queen remains the talk of the local community.During the May 14 event, 17-year-old Christian Nelsen was named prom queen, running as a write-in candidate. One of Nelsen's friends, Holly Smith, spoke of the help they provided in getting him elected: "The day of prom, we went downstairs, and he was yelling 'Vote for Christian Nelsen!' And I was helping people spell his name, or telling them how to write it on the ballot". Nelsen's boyfriend, Caleb Jett, was elected prom king. "I kinda got voted in because he got queen, and it was like 'Who do we vote for king?' and it was like 'Oh, well, his boyfriend, obviously, because that makes sense,'" he said. The two young men wore suits, shirts, and ties to the prom. When the results of the election were announced, they danced the king-queen dance together, Jett wearing his crown and Nelsen his tiara.Maine is one of only two states in {w|New England} that have not recognized {w|Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriages}. Though they are aware that not everyone supports them, the couple ran to combat high school stereotypes and to encourage more tolerance. Nelsen commented, "It doesn't matter if it's a guy or a girl who wins prom king or prom queen from now on. Anyone can win, and on that same notion any type of person can win. And I'm talking about the tolerance level of all people when I talk about that, so anyone who is bullied or even just under the radar can win this type of thing."The matter is expected to be brought up by interested citizens at an upcoming school committee meeting. Committee Chair Mark Lucier stated that the school is gathering information on the election, and that the committee may decide if it needs to address the future selection of prom kings and queens.== Sources ==

[[Scottish singer Jai McDowall wins fifth Britain's Got Talent series]]In the final, McDowall - who lives in the {w|South Ayrshire} village of {w|Tarbolton} - had sung {w|To Where You Are}, which was originally performed by {w|Josh Groban}. McDowall's victory was calculated via a public telephone voting system. The number of votes he received was a margin of under three per cent greater than the act who achieved second place: a 12-year-old male singer named Ronan Parke. According to {w|BBC News Online}, Parke had been considered the most likely act to win this series by bookmakers. A short time after his victory was announced, McDowall commented that he was feeling "absolutely amazing, fantastic...it's so much more, absolutely so much more". When interviewed afterwards, Parke said he "loved it, thank you to everyone who voted. Congratulations, Jai." Simon Cowell acknowledged "there was going to be a shock result" and that McDowall "wasn't one of the favourites coming in but tonight we could feel he nailed the song. He came in believing that he could win and I think he's a worthy winner." Meanwhile, on-air, judge {w|Amanda Holden} admitted that she "really, really wanted Ronan to win." {QuoteLeft|[I feel] absolutely amazing, fantastic ... it's so much more, absolutely so much more.|source={{w|Jai McDowall}}}The finale consisted of one programme featuring the finalists performing, which was broadcast from 1900 - 2100 {w|British Summer Time|BST} and a second programme, announcing the positions of the finalists; the latter was broadcast later in the night, from 2130 - 2200 BST. The programme also featured performances from two guests. {w|Jackie Evancho}, who achieved second place in the {w|America's Got Talent|fifth season} of {w|America's Got Talent}, performed {w|Nessun dorma} on the first programme. US singer-songwriter {w|Nicole Scherzinger}, scheduled to appear as a judge on {w|The X Factor}, appeared in the second show and performed {w|Right There}, the latest single to be released from her.In the run-up to the final, five semi-finals were broadcast live on ITV1 each night from Monday to Friday. A total of 41 acts appeared between them. British stand-up comedian {w|Michael McIntyre} and American actor {w|David Hasselhoff} made their debut appearances on the show's panel, alongside British actress Amanda Holden, who has judged for all the series so far, and British music executive {w|Simon Cowell}, who only judged for the semi-finals and the final.Earlier in the week, an unidentified Internet blogger, who stated that they were an employee of music corporation {w|Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music UK}, claimed that the programme had been unfairly pre-arranged due to Parke allegedly being familiar with Cowell and {w|Syco} for two years, already having a record contract, as well as prior arrangements being made for his appearance, including his clothing, hairstyle and behaviour. Parke achieved the largest number of public votes in the semi-final he appeared in on Monday, allowing him to earn his place in Saturday's final.On the fifth Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Friday, Cowell addressed these allegations and publicly denied them, stating: "There has been an allegation made in the papers - not in the papers actually, on the internet by somebody - that Ronan Parke had a previous recording contract with my record label, that I'd met him beforehand, both of which are complete and utter lies. The first time I met Ronan was the first time he appeared on this show. He entered the show of his own accord. He's 12 years old. This is a deliberate smear campaign."In a statement, Syco - a British entertainment company which Cowell is the {w|Chief executive officer|chief executive officer} of - responded by claiming that "[t]here is no truth in this story whatsoever. Ronan first came to Syco/Sony's attention when he entered this year's competition. Syco/Sony Music will not hesitate to take whatever legal action is appropriate to prevent further publication of these unfounded allegations." The Metropolitan Police Service have also reported that "[a]n allegation of malicious communications was made to Kensington and Chelsea police on Thursday 2 June" and that "[t]he allegation is being considered." In an interview with {w|BBC Radio Norfolk}, Maggie Parke - Ronan's mother - called the allegations "laughable" as there "couldn't be further from the truth". "There's no foundation in it whatsoever," said Maggie.In the final, Parke performed a cover of the {w|Kelly Clarkson} song {w|Because of You|Because of You} and placed second in the contest, behind McDowall. However, British tabloid newspaper {w|News of the World} has reported the intentions of Sony Music Entertainment to provide a record contract for the 12-year-old singer, allegedly valued at ?1,000,000. Speaking to the paper, a source familiar with Cowell commented: "We are not going to let malicious claims about Ronan impact his entire career. That would not be fair. The fact is, he is a little star. He¡¯s like our {w|Justin Bieber}. He launched his career on the internet. He is self-made." Musical manager {w|Jonathan Shalit} claimed that Parke "will be the most successful BGT winner ever, bigger than Bieber. I'd take him to {w|Hollywood}, straight to {w|Disney}." A source related to Britain's Got Talent cited the aforementioned fix allegations for Parke's failure to win the series, mentioning: "Sadly, the result had nothing to do with Ronan¡¯s talent. A lot of people believed the completely false smears on the internet and wanted to punish Simon as a result. The public are against him at the moment. This was their revenge."A London-based act named New Bounce achieved third place in the competition. Their act consists of four male singers: Mitchell, aged 16, 12-year-old MJ, Kuan, aged 13 and James, aged 12. In the final, the group performed a cover of the {w|Bill Withers} song {w|Ain't No Sunshine}. Simon Cowell subsequently compared their potential to that of {w|JLS}, who have achieved number 1 on music charts, claiming that "[t]his is a group that would work in the real world".Other acts who appeared in the final included Michael Collings, who is also a singer and plays a guitar for his act. Razy Gogonea performed a form of breakdancing known as {w|Popping|body-popping}. James Hobley was also an act who danced, performing contemporary dance routines. Steven Hall was another dancer, albeit one who performed for comedic effect, dancing to the sounds of various famous pop music tracks and lip-syncing the lyrics. Les Gibson performed a comedy act involving him {w|Impressionist|making impressions of various celebrities}, with Cowell, McIntyre and Hasselhoff amongst them, as well as {w|Ant & Dec}, who host the programme. Paul Gbegbaje and Jean Martyn were both musical acts, with the former playing the piano and the latter using an organ to make music. Gbegbaje played piano music which he had composed himself, while Martyn performed a medley of songs, amongst which was the John Travolta and {w|Olivia Newton-John} song {w|You're the One That I Want}. Martyn sang along to the song but was not clearly audible due to the absence of a microphone during her performance. She later explained that her performance had been previously rehearsed without the singing included. {HYS question right|Who do you think should have won Britain's Got Talent?}Below is a table addressing the rank the finalists of the fifth series of Britain's Got Talent achieved in Saturday's final. 
[[French broadcasters barred from saying "Facebook" or "Twitter" on air]]The French institution of regulation of broadcasting media has recently prohibited the use of the words "Facebook" and "Twitter" on television or radio broadcasts; except where these social networks are a central part of a news report. The regulation, issued by the {w|Conseil sup¨¦rieur de l'audiovisuel}, cites a 1992 statute governing the relationship between journalists and advertising, sponsorship, and "teleshopping". Mentioning the words "Facebook" or "Twitter" on air, in the eyes of the CSA, constitutes "clandestine advertising". CSA spokesperson Christine Kelly explained her organization's desire to set a level playing field when it comes to social networking: "Why give preference to Facebook, which is worth billions of dollars, when there are many other social networks that are struggling for recognition," she said. "This would be a distortion of competition. If we allow Facebook and Twitter to be cited on air, it's opening a Pandora¡¯s Box ¡ª other social networks will complain to us saying, 'why not us?'"Broadcasters now may not tell their listeners to "find us on Facebook", but rather "find us on social networks". However, they would still be allowed to name the social networking sites when either is involved in a news story.== Sources ==

A tornado is considered an EF-3 when its winds exceed 135 mph.The tornado which began in the community of {w|Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield}, Massachusetts tore a path of destruction on its 39 mile course through western Massachusetts, killing four and injuring 200. After passing through Westfield, the twister continued into {w|West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield}, Massachusetts ripping roofs from buildings and causing a few structures to collapse.It then crossed the {w|Connecticut River} into {w|Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield}, Massachusetts, the state's third largest city, where it caused extensive damage in the south side of the downtown area damaging commercial brick buildings and destroying many homes throughout the city.From Springfield, the tornado passed into the towns of {w|Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham}, Massachusetts and {w|Monson, Massachusetts|Monson}, Massachusetts where wide deforestation was caused by the tornado, including tree bark being stripped from remaining trunks. Furthermore, the center of Monson suffered widespread damage with many homes completely destroyed. The twister continued into {w|Brimfield State Forest} where it caused more deforestation and continued from many miles when it reached the {w|Southbridge Municipal Airport} where numerous aircraft "were lifted off the ground and into the woods east of the airport."The tornado continued until it reached the southwest part of {w|Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton}, Massachusetts where the tornado dissipated.

[[Act wins fifth Britain's Got Talent series]]Although I do not live there anymore, I am proud to say that I was born and raised in Sanford/Springvale.  When I read this article, my heart sank.  I've travelled around this country and all around this world and have come to expect to see this sort of thing in Europe or California, but not in my own hometown. Two Primary Critiques: 1) The only religious "authority" quoted was from the UCC, which is a famously far left-wing denomination.  Last time I checked, Sanford/Springvale is still mostly Roman Catholic.  Did this reporter from the Sanford News bother to ask a priest what he thought of all of this?  I think you would have gotten a very different response.  The quote from the UCC "minister" is completely distortive of the values of my hometown. 2) This was a vote of the kids.  And kids are heavily influenced by the media.  This sad event in my hometown should be a warning to parents there and everywhere to monitor carefully what kinds of messages their kids are receiving on television, from popular music and the Internet.  The fact that the kids voted as they did is an indictment of the wider society, who has taught them, under the cloak of the term "tolerance" that every kind of behavior is acceptable, when it is not.

The announcement comes only days after it was reported that Vanuatu had signed an agreement to recognise Abkhazia. Abkhazia has been fighting to break away and gain independence from Georgia. So far only Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and another tiny island state, Nauru, have announced the recognition of Abkhazia.The permanent representative to the United Nations for Vanuatu, {w|Donald Kalpokas}, released a statement saying "I have asked my capital whether this is true and they have denied it emphatically. We don't know who is responsible for declaring that this is true. As far as we are concerned we are dealing with Georgia, not Abkhazia," and "It is defamation for our country. This is disrespect".Officals from Abkhazia maintain Vanuatu recognized the nation, saying Kalpokas may have not heard the news. {w|Maxim Gvindzhia}, Abkhazian foreign minister, said negotiations started with the Premier of Vanuatu three months ago and on May 23rd the Prime Ministers of each nation signed a document that was transported via air freight between the two nations.Deputy Foriegn Minister of Georgia {w|Sergi Kapanadze} has also denied seeing any document relating to the recognition. He said "The only way we can check to see if it is correct is to ask the representatives of Vanuatu if it is correct or not. For us that contact is the ambassador of Vanautu to the United Nations."

Employee {w|Phil Schiller} discussed new multitouch gestures along with a dynamic task manager named Mission Control that shows open applications. During the keynote, Schiller said, "The Mac has outpaced the PC industry every quarter for five years running and with OS X Lion we plan to keep extending our lead." It also adds full support for the Mac port of the popular {w|App Store}, full screen applications, iOS-style app icon lists called Launchpad, and other iOS-like features including a revamped Mail and Auto Save among others. Mac OS X Lion was announced at a different Apple event several months ago and will replace {w|Mac OS X Snow Leopard}, which was released in 2009.Soon after, the company also introduced the latest installment in its popular mobile operating system {w|iOS|iOS}. The fifth version introduces around 200 new features, including a revamped notification system, which combines messages and notifications from all applications installed on the user's device. {w|Scott Forestall}, an Apple employee, also revealed that iOS devices would no longer require a computer for setup, allowing users to 'cut the cord' between their devices and PCs. Magazines and newspapers also have a new folder interface; the Twitter social network is now integrated significantly into iOS devices. Improvements to the mobile {w|Apple Safari|Safari} browser were also announced; tabbed browsing and a Reader feature introduce desktop-like functionality. Finally, new camera features are built in, including the ability to take snapshots from the lock screen, as well as iMessages, a new messaging platform for iPhones and iPads.CEO Steve Jobs returned to the stage to reveal Apple's new cloud services offering, {w|iCloud}. The service integrates with Lion and iOS applications and syncs data between a user's iOS devices. For example, calendar events created on a user's laptop would be sent to their iPhone through iCloud. Apps, books, documents, photos, and more purchased or created on one device will be shared with others. The service is intended to launch in the fall of 2011 alongside iOS 5 and will be available with 5 {w|gigabytes} of storage for 10 devices for free. Earlier this year, Apple opened a 500,000 square foot data center in North Carolina intended to facilitate this new service. Jobs rounded the services off by unveiling a new {w|iTunes} feature that mirrors a user's library in the cloud, allowing them to listen and download music to authorized devices. "We are going to demote the PC to just be a device. We are going to move the digital hub, the center of your digital life, into the cloud,¡± said Steve Jobs during the keynote. iCloud and iOS 5 will be released in the fall of 2011; Apple announced no new hardware products.== Sources ==

[[Chilean deputy's 'homophobic' comment on Facebook causes controversy]]A "homophobic" comment on Facebook by Chilean {w|Chamber of Deputies of Chile|deputy} Enrique Estay has generated some controversy."[The government is] worried about the queers and not about the swarm of {w|Concert of Parties for Democracy|concerted} bureaucrats who obstruct everything, so that the benefits do not reach to the poorest and middle class," said Estay on his Facebook profile on June 2. "I will not be quiet, until I see changes! [...] It is frustrating to me. A government that is thought to be right-winged, yet it governs with the left-winged ideas and people," he added in a comment."Well done, deputy! Simply speak out loud, well spoken, we are only making a country full of queers and lesbians, that's the only thing they [{w|Concert of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci¨®n} politicians] care about, instead of leaving them alone and dedicate themselves to work for the poorest," said one of the comments in response to Estay's status."It seems like these energumens don't live in Chile; it seems like these persons, so sons-of-bitches, don't understand the reality; it seems like these fucking mummies [momio, pejorative word to call a right-winged person] have their brains connected to their asses, because every thinking, every word [they say] is worth like that, a royal shit," Facebook user Millaray Essence said on No a Pi?era 2010.Estay's comment was denounced before the Committees of Human Rights and Ethics of the Chamber of Deputies by the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation on Monday. In a press release, the MOVILH said that "Estay's statements clearly seek to denigrate people because of their sexual orientation and gender identity, which implies a violation of human rights, as well as inciting social, cultural, and political odiousness, which is not at the level of his investiture."Enrique Estay responded to MOVILH's comments by saying that "[f]or queers we are referring to homosexuals. The term 'gay' is a new expression which means 'similar' and is unrelated to homosexuality." He also said that when calling homosexuals "queers", he "didn't mean it to be offensive, though I often say things by their name, as they are, and I have always understood that in Chile homosexuals are the queers." He concluded, saying, "It is my Facebook, and that's the way I used it to specifically mention the homosexuals."Enrique Estay has represented District 49 in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile since 2006, having been elected twice for the office. He is a lawyer and member of the {w|Independent Democrat Union}, one of Chile's right-wing parties. As of Wednesday, Estay deleted his Facebook status.
[[Scottish university to introduce comic studies degree]]In the {w|Central Lowlands} of Scotland, the {w|University of Dundee} is to become the first university in the United Kingdom to provide degrees in comic studies. The university has said that courses for its comic studies subject within the English section will commence in September 2011.The city of {w|Dundee} is known to be the headquarters for {w|D. C. Thomson & Co.}, a publishing company whose works include various comic books, such as {w|The Beano}, {w|The Broons}, {w|The Dandy} and {w|Oor Wullie}. Dr. Chris Murray, a leading British authority on comic books, will be leading the comic studies programme. "This is a very exciting time for comics scholarship, and I am delighted to be able to offer this postgraduate course on comics," he explained. "This is a unique opportunity to give this important medium the attention it deserves, and to allow those with an interest in comics to study it in detail."Those organising courses for the degree believe that comic books now appeal to adults as well as children due to their impact in the areas of politics, art and literature, as well as aspects of popular culture. Amongst the program will be the examinations of comics of an autobiographical nature and similarities with the culture of comic books on an international scale. Students who complete the {w|Master of Letters} learning program ¡ª running either full-time for a year and two-years if done part-time ¡ª will be eligible for a {w|Doctor of Philosophy} in comic studies.Dr. Murray has also noted: "Employability is an important consideration for any postgraduate programme, and it lies at the heart of what we aim to do with this course. There will be practical advice on publishing and developing a career as a comics scholar, writer or artist, and we hope to arrange work placements for students. Comics and graphic novels are becoming an increasingly important form of literature, art and field of study, and it is our intention that our graduates are at the forefront either as researchers, writers, artists or filling other roles within the industry."== Sources == 
[[Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to move into Kensington Palace, London]]British media has reported that {w|Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William} and his recently wedded wife, {w|Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate}, are to move their London residence into {w|Kensington Palace}, close to {w|Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park}. Two units in the Palace, labeled Apartments 8 and 9, were previously occupied by {w|Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles} and {w|Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana}, William's parents, when they married in 1981. Prince William and his brother {w|Prince Harry of Wales|Prince Harry} went to nursery and school nearby. Diana also lived in Kensington Palace after her separation and divorce from Prince Charles.However, the newlyweds will not live in Apartments 8 and 9, as they are currently being used as office space. They will instead live in a small apartment that was previously occupied by staff. The palace has undergone some renovations, including asbestos removal.The couple is also set to choose one "housekeeper-dresser", who will provide valet service for the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate will continue to buy her own clothes, and the new servant is not to be seen as a "stylist". The position has been advertised internally within {w|Buckingham Palace}. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to move within a few weeks, before they leave on a trip to Canada and the United States. The London residence is expected to be used only as a starter home for about a year. The couple will keep their permanent residence without personal staff in {w|Anglesey, Wales}, where William serves on the {w|Royal Air Force} as a search-and-rescue pilot. They will continue to run their Household Office at {w|St James's Palace}. == Sources == 
[[Skype suffers downtime in Europe]]The {w|instant messaging} and {w|VoIP} communications company Skype has suffered from an unexpected outrage across Europe since 10:00 AM UTC today. Users were not able to log in and Skype did not announce a cause of the problem.Skype initially left a message on its website and Twitter which reads, "A small number of you may have problems signing in to Skype. We¡¯re investigating the cause, and hope to have more details to share soon."It was suggested by many users that Microsoft might be related to the Skype behaviour, however the purchase of Skype by Microsoft is not yet completed ¡ª Microsoft do not currently have any operational control over the Skype servers.Skype investigated a similar issue two weeks ago, its solution for which included an automatic update. This update deleted a file called "shared.xml" on users' computers. While it seemed to resolve the issue, the reason for this was not clear. Online newspaper {W|The Register} reports that today's issue is not dissimilar from that experienced previously.Further investigation by Skype showed that the event was caused by "configuration problems", but Skype has not published further details. The situation was claimed to be "stabilizing" by Skype later in the evening.== Sources == 
[[Smoke from Arizona fire spreads to other states]]Smoke from eastern Arizona's {w|Wallow Fire} has drifted into New Mexico and Colorado, where officials have issued a health advisory. The wildfire in Arizona continued to burn Tuesday night when weather conditions settled down, although conditions will likely become worse Wednesday. Covering 365 square miles, the fire has created hazy conditions as far away as Iowa. Residents of small communities including {w|Greer, Arizona|Greer} and {w|Alpine, Arizona|Alpine} have been warned to evacuate. The Wallow Fire is currently the nation's largest wildfire; another fire is burning in {w|southern Arizona}. So far, about 3,000 people have evacuated the area around the Wallow Fire.Around 2,500 firefighters are working to combat the wildfire; around four buildings have burned so far while hundreds more are at risk. On Monday, Arizona governor {w|Jan Brewer} signed a state of emergency declaration allowing access to special funds. High winds up to 60 MPH have been reported, allowing the fire to continue to move north. Joe Reinarz, the firefighting operation's commander, said, "The bad news is it's supposed to pick back up all the way through Thursday." U.S. Highway 180 was closed by officials for around two miles because of thick smoke obscuring drivers' visibility. The wildfire is decimating the ponderosa pine forest in the area; Kelly Wood, a {w|Pinetop, Arizona|Pinetop} Fire Department spokesperson, said, "Normally, you can see the forest for miles. Now, there¡¯s just smoke."The large amounts of smoke have started to take a toll on area residents. Director of the local White Mountain Regional Medical Center Jerry Campeau said, "It¡¯s very irritating. The first symptom is sinus pain. Then the throat gets irritated, sometimes so badly you can cough up blood. When you start to have tightness in the chest, then it¡¯s serious." Patients have been taken away by road, as the smoke prevented any air transportation. The blaze began May 29 in the Bear Wallow area and has become the second largest in Arizona's history. {w|National Weather Service} meteorologist Kyle Fredin said a large area of high pressure was causing smoke to be blown eastward. He said, "These fires have been going pretty good for the last four to six days, and with the dry conditions, they¡¯re burning hot right now."== Sources == 
[[Russian reverse engineers Skype; uploads source to public]]A Russian programming researcher Efim Bushmanov uploaded the Skype source on {w|Blogspot}, {W|BitTorrent|Torrent}, and {W|Github} last Tuesday. Bushmanov said that his {w|release engineering} work is "not finished," and stated that the purpose of its release is "community involvement."Bushmanov said that his motivation was a story in the {W|Wall Street Journal} which described possible eavesdropping on Skype by governmental agencies. The upload to public would allow people to participate with further work on the reverse engineering which is not yet finished.Skype responded by a promise to support security of the Skype users and to investigate and prevent the attacks this can cause: "This unauthorized use of our application for malicious activities like spamming/phishing infringes on Skype's intellectual property. We are taking all necessary steps to prevent/defeat nefarious attempts to subvert Skype's experience. Skype takes its users' safety and security seriously and we work tirelessly to ensure each individual has the best possible experience."Some public said that Microsoft is to blame for the lack of stability of Skype since its acquisition plans were announced in the beginning of May. However, Microsoft has no operational control over Skype servers yet. The acquisition is planned to be finished by the end of 2011. Microsoft's response included a note that despite that they have some Windows code shared with Russian government, they would fear to share Skype code, and make strong attempts to keep it unavailable to third parties.Paul Ducklin, head of technology for security company Sophos, noted the presence of {w|Interactive Disassembler|IDA Pro} files in the downloads published by Bushmanov, indicating that his reverse engineering had not been conducted in a "{w|Clean room design|clean room}" fashion. The project included shared files which were enough for the tech company Hex-Rays to verify that the version of IDA Pro used was pirated.== Sources == 
[[Trump criticizes media bias towards Obama, especially during UK state visit]]Business mogul and television personality Donald Trump spoke at the annual Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, D.C. last Friday, criticizing heavy media bias towards US President Barack Obama. Trump especially highlighted the lack of media attention after Obama made two gaffes during his recent state visit to the UK in May. Obama signed a guestbook and dated it 2008, instead of 2011. Also, during a state banquet held at {w|Buckingham Palace}, Obama spoke over the British national anthem, "{w|God Save the Queen}", as he toasted Queen Elizabeth II. Footage of the banquet shows Her Majesty speaking first, then proposing a toast to the people of the United States, the President, and Mrs. Obama. The guests rise from their seats and stand at attention as the US national anthem plays. The President is seen doing a civilian salute during the anthem. The President speaks, and proposes a toast to the Queen. He says "To Her Majesty the Queen" too early in his speech, however, prompting the band to play the British national anthem. Nonetheless, he continues to speak over the music. When he finishes speaking, the anthem is still playing, but he turns and raises his glass to the Queen. The Queen remains standing at attention, not accepting Obama's toast, and Obama lowers his glass. Everyone finally raises their glasses in a toast once the band finishes playing the anthem.British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said of the anthem blunder, "I thought you did exactly the right thing." The press also has seemed to focus less on the gaffe, and more on Obama strengthening US-UK relations. "I said to myself, 'I wonder what would have happened if George Bush signed it May of '08? I wonder if almost anybody was three years off,'" Trump said.Trump also criticized the President's fiscal policies, especially high gas prices, rising unemployment, and the national debt. He was speaking at a two-day forum, named the Faith and Freedom Conference and Strategy Briefing, along with possible candidates for the Republican nomination for President next year. Although he announced last month that he will not seek the Republican nomination, he has still left open the possibility of running as an independent candidate. == Sources ==

As well as the Daleks, Skelton used his voice to assume the roles of {w|Cyberman|Cybermen} and the {w|Kroton|Krotons} within Doctor Who. However, despite the prominence of the characters and their voices, Skelton once said that he could walk down the street without being identified by others. "People don't say, 'There's Zippy,' or ask me to say, 'Exterminate!' I sometimes wish they did," said Skelton.Hilary Skelton, the wife of Roy, stated: "Roy had a great sense of humour. He wrote {w|Rainbow#The "adult" version|Naughty Rainbow} for a competition. We still have the original script." This piece of writing was of a similar format to the original programme, only with numerous {w|Euphemism|euphemisms} used for comic effect. The sketch has achieved popularity within society. Hilary also said that her husband "loved going to work every day. His first love had been theatre but he brought theatre to Rainbow."According to Hilary, Roy would have wanted to have a "green funeral," during which his body would be buried in a cardboard coffin. He also would have wanted people to be able to write on the coffin, Hilary noted.== Sources ==

[[Eritrea accuses four Britons of espionage and terrorism]]The government of Eritrea has accused four British men who were detained last December of espionage and terrorism. The men were working for Protection Vessels International, a maritime security company, when they disappeared on December 24, 2010. According to the company, the group was forced to make an unscheduled stop at the port of {w|Massawa} due to rough weather, refuelling and equipment repairs.A statement made on television by the Eritrean authorities said that the men had a variety of weapons, including 18 sniper rifles and "1,700 bullets." The statement also claimed that "there is high possibility that such military hardware is intended for perpetrating acts of terrorism and sabotage." PVI hit back at the claims, saying that the weapons were "standard issue for antipiracy operations."Paul Gibbins, a spokesman for PVI, spoke to the British newspaper {w|The Daily Telegraph}, saying "[t]his is a gross misunderstanding and we regret the situation that we find ourselves in. We will continue to work very hard for the men¡¯s release and we welcome any dialogue with the Eritrean authorities."Two of the four men being held are former {w|Royal Marines}. Three of the men have been named as Adrian Troy, Christopher Collison, and Alun Sims.

He said to {w|Reuters} that "[t]he minister was killed by a relative from inside his house, it was unfortunate and unexpected. A big bomb must have been put under the minister's bed. The explosives on the suicide bomber could not destroy the concrete room that way." Ahmed Mohamed, the minister's driver spoke about the attack, saying that "[s]uddenly, I heard a loud explosion. I saw the flesh of the suicide bomber in the balcony near the minister's house. I went into his room and saw him lying injured." At the time of the attack Mogadishu, as well as other parts of Somalia, have been hit with two days of political protests.

[[Up to 31 reported dead as Libyan government troops attack Misrata]]Pro-Muammar al-Gaddafi forces attacked Libya's third-largest city of {w|Misrata} for much of Friday, killing up to 31 rebel fighters in the most violent day since the city came under rebel control in April.Most of the fighting took place just west of the city, where Gaddafi's troops launched an attack with both infantry troops and four tanks, as well as lighter weaponry, such as rockets and mortars.  Rebel fighters were reportedly able to repel the assault, destroying two tanks and advancing by about 6 miles.Estimates of those killed by the fighting varied from as low as 22 to as high as 31, with up to 60 more reported injured, according to doctors in Misrata, making Friday the deadliest day for rebel troops since they gained control of the city.The new assault appears to be in response to NATO helicopter attacks against Gaddafi.While NATO aircraft attacked both communications and military equipment on Thursday night, there were no strikes by coalition aircraft during the fighting on Friday. One rebel fighter said: "I don't know why NATO didn't bomb. [The tanks] were very easy to see."  While NATO has been criticized by rebels for failing to provide support, one unnamed official said that NATO is "in Libya to protect civilians. The rebels have proved themselves to be very courageous but we are not there to act as their air force."
[[Wikinews interviews US National Archives Wikipedian in Residence]]Dominic McDevitt-Parks, a prolific contributor to Wikipedia and a graduate student in history and archives management, agreed to answer a few questions about his new role as "{w|Wikipedia:GLAM/BM/Wikipedian in Residence|foreign=force|Wikipedian in Residence}" at the US {w|National Archives and Records Administration}."Wikipedians in Residence" are volunteers placed with institutions, such as museums and libraries, to facilitate use of those institutions' resources on Wikipedia.According to a {w|Pew Research Center|Pew Internet} report, 42 percent of Americans use Wikipedia as an online source of information. The online, collaborative encyclopedia boasts more than 3.5 million articles in English and versions in over 250 languages. Given the website's vast readership, the {w|Archivist of the United States} has proclaimed himself "a big fan of Wikipedia" and emphasizes the need for the National Archives to work with the project. The Archives posted the internship listing in March, expressing its desire for an employee who "will work as a community coordinator and strengthen the relationship between the Archives and the Wikipedian community through a range of activities".McDevitt-Parks, who describes himself as a "history buff, a word nerd, a news junkie and an occasional pedant," is a 24-year-old graduate student at {w|Simmons College|Simmons College} in Boston. On Wikipedia, he has contributed for more than seven years under the username "Dominic", his work focusing mostly on Latin American history.He began his work at the Archives in late May, and since then he has undertaken numerous projects, including uploading onto Wikipedia 200 photos taken by {w|Ansel Adams} for the {w|National Park Service}. Although those photos have always remained in the public domain, accessing their high-definition versions could be problematic. Researchers who wanted to view the files had to visit the Archives facilities in {w|College Park, Maryland|College Park}, Maryland.McDevitt-Parks is also preparing a "{w|Wikipedia:GLAM/NARA/Today's Document challenge|foreign=force|Today's Document challenge}" on Wikipedia, where works featured as "Today's Document" on the Archives' website are also the main focus of newly written or expanded encyclopedia articles displayed on Wikipedia's home page. The first ¡ª and so far only ¡ª winner of the challenge was the Wikipedia article "{w|Desegregation in the United States Marine Corps}", which incorporated an Archives-held photo of the first African-American recruit to the {w|US Marine Corps}. Before the challenge, according to McDevitt-Parks, "a thorough history of desegregation in the U.S. Marines didn't exist in Wikipedia's knowledge ecosystem. The topic wasn't totally ignored, but simply split among related entries; a devoted, focused article never existed solely in its own right."The "Wikipedian in Residence" position falls within the Archives' social media staff within the Open Government division of Information Services, since the institution's goal is to distribute as much content to the widest audience possible. The internship is 40 hours per week from mid-May to late August.Wikimedia's projects can do more than just reach people, though. It's not merely a content host or a forum, like YouTube, {w|Flickr}, Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. Wikimedia is a community with an intellectual mission. It will not only make holdings findable, but it will add value to them. They write encyclopedia articles related to the holdings of cultural institutions, or to subjects for which holdings are valuable source material or illustrations; they organize, categorize, and even sometimes digitally restore images; they transcribe and proofread textual documents. They are doing this for their personal fulfillment, nearly always without the knowledge and cooperation of associated cultural institutions. Indeed, thousands of Wikimedians are already engaged in their own little projects which donated content or expertise can help along; both parties are interested in adding value to their work by partnering with the other.Finally, Wikimedia is unique among the major online fora and hosts for cultural content in that it shares cultural institutions' commitment to open access and public education. Wikipedia is a non-profit, and creating free public knowledge is its sole purpose. All original content is released under a free copyright license so that it can be widely disseminated without permission or fee. In fact, its commitment to freedom of information is so strong that it often cannot even accept works from some cultural institutions which restrict their use in some way, and making institutions truly free and compatible with Wikipedia is one of the jobs of Wikipedans in Residence. Wikipedia is not just a venue for presenting our cultural heritage, it is an active ally for all institutions that seek to do so.As a Wikimedian, I have been deeply immersed in various aspects of the project for many years now. I first started back in 2004, and have been an administrator since 2005. Along the way, I served as arbitrator, CheckUser, oversighter, and OTRSer, gaining a useful perspective on some of the project's inner workings and governance. I've also done outreach to real people as a {w|Wikipedia:Campus Ambassadors|foreign=force|Wikipedia Campus Ambassador} for university students in Boston. I am cross-project Wikimedian, having also been very involved in {w|Wiktionary} over the years, where I am also an administrator. I have written content ranging from dictionary definitions of modern colloquialisms to articles on Chilean revolutionaries. But, most importantly, I hope that my familiarity with the culture and practices of Wikimedians will help facilitate this National Archives collaboration. One of the biggest challenges is that we need Wikimedians to get on board with the project in a big way. This is an incredible opportunity for us as a project, but it requires a special community effort to take full advantage of it. We need volunteers to tag articles, to categorize media, to help with templates and coding tools, to write related article content, to transcribe and proofread texts, to add new images to articles, to digitally restore images, and so on. I can personally serve as the point of contact between the National Archives and Wikimedia, but it needs to be much more than that to be a successful project. At this point, the project spaces I am creating on-wiki are my attempt to create an inviting and useful infrastructure to serve as a hub for this effort, but they are not organically grown like most Wikimedia projects. I, and various helpers with templates and coding, have magicked them into existence in the last few weeks. They need participants to sign up and adopt them as their own so we can really get the ball rolling.
[[Court rules Massey can appeal US restrictions in mine disaster investigation]]In a unanimous decision, a US federal appeals court issued a ruling Friday against the federal government, in favor of {w|Massey Energy|Massey Energy Co}, owner of the Upper Branch Mine in West Virginia, the location of last year's {w|Upper Big Branch Mine disaster|mine disaster} that killed 29 workers. The court ruled the company may appeal the restrictions placed on it by a government order hindering the company's ability to conduct its own internal investigation of the disaster. The order controlling Massey's investigations into the disaster was placed on Massey immediately after the incident by the {w|Mine Safety and Health Administration} when it seized control of the coal mine six hours after the blast on April 5.MSHA's controls prohibited Massey from "taking or retaining photographs, collecting and preserving mine dust samples, employing mine mapping technology, and participating in or objecting to any destructive testing of materials gathered underground." Massey said MSHA's restrictions prevented the company from evaluating the accident site before it was altered by investigators, and denied Massey the chance to gather evidence to use in the company's defense.Massey's appeal to the {w|Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission} to void the order by MSHA was denied by the commission. It based its decision on its interpretation of the {w|Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977|Mine Act} that it had no authority to consider Massey's appeal. The {w|United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit} set aside this decision, finding the commission's interpretation of the act was "simply untenable" and the government's actions had denied Massey the opportunity to gather "potentially important exculpatory evidence".The court rejected the commission's position that the Mine Act's language was ambiguous, allowing the government flexibility in its implementation. Rather, the court said, "No matter how you parse it, [the act] is a model of near-perfect clarity. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a clearer expression of congressional language." It also rejected the commission's position that the case was moot: "This case is not moot. Indeed, even the {w|United States Secretary of Labor|[Labor] Secretary's} counsel recognized the near-frivolity of this argument, and made only a half-hearted attempt to persuade us."The court's ruling comes after a state government-comissioned report issued on May 19 by investigators found Massey Energy responsible for the deaths of the 29 workers. The workers were killed in an explosion that could have been avoided, the report said, if Massey had put in place standard safety procedures."The story of Upper Big Branch is a cautionary tale of hubris. A company that was a towering presence in the {W|Appalachian} coal fields operated its mines in a profoundly reckless manner, and 29 coal miners paid with their lives for the corporate risk taking," the report read. "The company's ventilation system did not adequately ventilate the mine. As a result, explosive gases were allowed to build up." The report detailed claims Massey threatened miners with termination if they stopped work in areas that lacked adequate oxygen levels and listed numerous other state and federal safety standards that Massey failed to follow. Also blamed in the report was MSHA for failing to enforce federal regulations.The report was considered by the those in the mining industry as especially direct and "hard hitting". It firmly rejected conclusions reached by Massey officials that the incident was caused by an unexpected, massive, and uncontrollable {w|methane} bubble eruption, an occurrence that Massey said it could neither predict nor manage.  The company immediately challenged the report and issued its own report on June 3, blaming the blast on an act of nature and denying the company's safety culture was at fault.

[[Casey Stoner wins 2011 British MotoGP]]The win at {w|Silverstone} gives Stoner his forth win of the season and places him ahead of previous championship leader {w|Jorge Lorenzo}, who crashed out during the race. {w|Marco Simoncelli} and {w|Ben Spies} also failed to finish the race after suffering crashes. The race was affected by bad driving conditions due to heavy rain but a large crowd still attended despite no British riders taking part in the MotoGP.Speaking to the BBC after his victory Stoner said "At the beginning we didn't get a great start. But the bike felt good, and I waited for the tyres to get up to temperature. In the first lap I had water in my visor, so for the first five or six laps I couldn't really see properly. I couldn't see any puddles. But finally the water went away and I was able to do the lap times I wanted, and open up a gap."German riders {w|Stefan Bradl} and {w|Jonas Folger} won the Moto2 and 125cc classification races.
[[BBC Television Centre placed up for sale]]The {w|BBC Television Centre} has been placed up for sale by the corporation. Plans to sell the centre originally came forward in 2007 but the BBC only appointed Lambert Smith Hampton, a commercial property consultant, in November of last year. The building which is based in {w|Shepherds Bush}, London was opened in 1960 and is the home of {w|BBC News} and {w|BBC Vision}.The BBC stated they were interested in preserving parts of the building while setting up a "hub for creative businesses and a visitor destination."  According to the head of BBC Workplace, {w|Chris Kane}, "With high investor demand for commercial property in London and a shortage of landmark sites as distinctive as Television Centre, we anticipate strong competition for both conventional and innovative proposals."The property has been valued between ?150 million to ?300 million but is expected to fetch around ?200 million.5000 staff are currently based at the centre which BBC bosses hope to be empty by 2015. The BBC is creating a new development in Salford, Greater Manchester. Several departments including {w|BBC Sport}, {w|BBC Breakfast}, and children's shows are moving to Salford while BBC News is being relocated within central London.
[[First Libertarian Party presidential nominee John Hospers dies at 93]]He later added: "He was the sweetest man alive, and a very loyal friend of mine. He will be greatly missed by all.

[[Fire in central London causes traffic chaos]]A fire on {w|Aldwych}, in central London, England, has led to serious traffic problems in the area since this morning.  Many roads have been closed for some hours while firefighters attempt to extinguish the blaze.  There are no reports of any casualties.The blaze is at Marconi House, a ten-storey building currently being converted into flats and a luxury hotel, near the church of {w|St Mary le Strand}, {w|King's College London} and {w|Somerset House}.  The alert was raised at about 11 a.m. {w|British Summer Time|BST}.  About 75 firefighters in 15 fire engines were sent to the scene, from depots including {w|Homerton} and {w|Whitechapel} in east London and {w|Old Kent Road} in south-east London.  Ambulances, including hazardous response teams, and police officers are also in attendance.  Local roads, including {w|Waterloo Bridge} and parts of {w|Strand, London|the Strand}, have been closed to traffic, causing significant disruption to travellers. At least ten bus routes are affected, and the {w|London Underground} is accepting bus tickets for travel within the affected area.The cause of the fire is unknown at present, but is located in the roof of the building.  The smoke could be seen from large parts of central London, and was still coming from the roof some hours after it started.When Wikinews returned to the area at 7.45 p.m. local time, traffic was still prevented from passing the building although the pavement on the south side of Aldwych had been reopened to pedestrians.  The scene was still under the control of the {w|London Fire Brigade}, with police cars and ambulances still in attendance.  Waterloo Bridge and the Strand were still closed to vehicles, with about fifteen fire engines or LFB command vehicles parked close by and many hosepipes running across the road.  Some smoke could still be seen coming from the roof of the building, but less than before.  Some damage to the roof was also visible.== Sources == 
[[Apples top most contaminated produce list]]According to the United States-based {w|Environmental Working Group}, apples rank as the  most contaminated fruit and vegetable produce.The consumer advocacy group's Dirty Dozen list, released Monday, ranks fruit and vegetables most highly contaminated by {w|pesticides} and {w|fungicides}. Apples are followed  by celery, strawberries, peaches, spinach, nectarines, grapes, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, blueberries, lettuce and kale or collard greens. The Dirty Dozen list is part of the EWG's seventh annual Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce along with the Clean 15 list, headed by onions, corn, pineapple, asparagus and watermelon. Consumers taking the recommended five-a-day from the Dirty Dozen were predicted by EWG to consume an average of 14 different pesticides; in contrast, those choosing from the Clean 15 could be expected to be exposed to two or less contaminants¡ªa claimed reduction of 92 percent.For the report, EWG synthesized data from the U.S  {w|U.S. Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture} and {w|Food and Drug Administration} collected between 2000 and 2009. Produce was washed and peeled, if necessary, and then each was given a score based on the the level, type and number of pesticides found in the produce. The lists are meant to aid consumers in making safer choices as they shop for produce. "Pesticides are toxic," said EWG analyst Sonya Lunder, "[t]hey are designed to kill things and most are not good for you. The question is, how bad are they?""A growing body of scientific evidence shows pesticide consumption can cause lasting harm to children's brain development," wrote a group of leading physicians and public health experts in a May 6 letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. "Three recently published studies have all shown that early life exposure of children to pesticides can cause persistent problems in learning, memory and behavior."The pesticides that coat produce have been linked to various health problems says Alex Formuzis, spokesperson for EWG. Although pesticides remained after washing and peeling, Formuzis said the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables make them a better choice than most other snack foods: "If it's a choice between an apple and potato chips, choose the apple".Pesticides and fungicides are used by farmers to kill insects, other pests, and to extend produce shelf life. The {w|Alliance for Food and Farming}, a trade group, criticized  the new report. Teresa Thorne of the AFF said, "Not only are farmers of fruits and vegetables meeting requirements set by the {w|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency} for pesticide residues, but their crops are shown to have either no residues at all or with residues 10 times to 100 times below already stringent safety limits."== Sources == 
[[Woman's body found in home of Papua New Guinea leader]]A woman has been found dead at the home of {w|Sam Abal}, the acting prime minister of Papua New Guinea. The body was discovered in the garden of the property early Monday morning. Abal's adopted son, Teo, was arrested on Wednesday after a two-day search; he was reportedly the last person to be seen with the woman.A murder investigation has been opened by Papua New Guinea police. Abal, currently living in a local hotel, released a statement, saying: "The alleged murder took place within the perimeters of my private home. All family members living with me are immediate suspects and are subject to investigation and questioning by police."Police Commissioner {w|Anthony Wagambie} commented on Teo Abal's arrest, saying, "He was caught last night at the Pondorosa Hotel in Port Moresby and is currently being interviewed by police."Sam Abal has been the acting prime minister of Papua New Guinea since April of this year, when 75-year-old leader {w|Michael Somare} underwent heart surgery. Somare's recovery has been extended but no date has been given as to his return.
[[US congressmen sue Obama for military action in Libya]]Several US congressmen have filed a bipartisan suit against the administration of US president Barack Obama, claiming its military operations in Libya are illegal because they did not have legislative approval. Wednesday's lawsuit comes one day after House {w|US House Speaker|Speaker} {w|John Boehner} expressed his concerns in a letter to the president that his administration has violated the {w|War Powers Resolution}. US federal law requires that, if Congress does not approve military action, the president must withdraw forces within 60 days from the beginning of the conflict, and that the withdrawal must be completed by the 90th day. The latter deadline will pass this Sunday. The White House is sending Congress a report to answer questions presented in a House resolution passed on June 3, which set a two-week deadline. The deadline to respond was this Friday, and Boehner claims that the failure to do so would also have been a violation of the War Powers Resolution. It is common for the president and the legislature to argue over war powers. The US Constitution establishes the president as the commander-in-chief of the military, but it also gives Congress the power to declare war. The White House believes that it is complying with the War Powers Resolution by frequently briefing Congress on the Libya mission, having testified at ten congressional hearings and participated in more than 30 staff briefings. Boehner argues, however, that the administration should have sought explicit congressional approval for the action. The lawsuit, filed by Dennis Kucinich and {w|Walter B. Jones}, along with eight other congressmen, will cite the legislature's "{w|power of the purse}" in addition to the War Powers Resolution. It will "challenge the executive branch's circumvention of Congress," and its use of UN and NATO mandates rather than Congress to justify its own actions, according to Kucinich. == Sources == 
[[New York Assembly passes same-sex marriage bill]]On Wednesday, the New York {w|New York State Assembly|State Assembly} passed a bill that would legalize {w|same-sex marriage}, with a vote of 80 in favor  of the bill to 63 against. This is the third time a resolution legalizing same-sex marriage passed the Assembly in recent years. The bill must next be approved by the {w|New York State Senate|Senate}. If it becomes a law, New York would become the sixth United States state where same-sex marriage is legal, joining Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Washington D.C., and Iowa. It was briefly legal in California, but was rescinded by the voters in 2008 by a measure called {w|Proposition 8}.Assemblyman Charles Lavine said he thought {w|Founding Fathers of the United States|America's Founding Fathers} "have smiles on their faces," in light of the bill's passage. Same-sex marriage opponent Assemblyman Dov Hikind said God knows gay marriage is wrong.As of Wednesday the measure appeared to be one vote short of passage in the Senate. Governor {w|Andrew Cuomo|Cuomo}, who has been a strong supporter of the bill, has said in the past he would not introduce the bill unless he believed it would pass. On Tuesday he introduced the bill, in both the Assembly and the Senate. Opponents of the bill in the Senate are considering whether to allow it to come to a Senate vote. Two Republicans in the Senate have said they would support the bill if it came to a vote. {w|Majority Leader of the New York State Senate|Republican Majority Leader} of the Senate {w|Dean Skelos} has said if it were brought to a vote, "If they favor it, I¡¯ve always said, they can vote for it."== Sources == 
[[US Representative Anthony Weiner resigns over sexual conduct]]Weiner told reporters it was "impossible" to continue in his role after the events of the last few weeks, including revelations that he was involved in sexual relationships with a number of young women over the internet, including sending lewd photos of himself, and then lying about his actions to reporters.  He announced his resignation at a press conference in a {w|Brooklyn} senior center where 20 years ago he began his political career and apologized for his "personal mistakes". His wife, {w|Huma Abedin}, did not accompany him, but Weiner apologized to her in his speech, saying that he hopes "most importantly, that my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage that I've caused." He took no questions from reporters.On June 6, Weiner had admitted to corresponding with women he met on the internet, including  exchanging lewd photos. But on June 11 he declared  in an emotional interview he would not resign.  Under pressure from Democrats, Weiner  requested a two-week leave of absence from his position in order to obtain treatment to become "a better husband and healthier person." However, Democratic politicians became increasingly anxious to put the growing scandal behind them, as it distracted members from more important issues such as problems with {w|Medicare} and the need for more jobs.  As the scandal gained momentum, a variety of politicians, including Nancy Pelosi, the {w|Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader}, called on him to resign. President Barack Obama said he would resign if he were in Weiner's place in an interview with ABC News."Weiner exercised poor judgment in his actions and poor judgment in his reaction to the revelations," Pelosi said in a statement after Weiner announced his resignation. "Today, he made the right judgment in resigning." The scandal came to light May 27 after Weiner accidentally sent a photograph of his {w|crotch} on his public stream on the social networking website Twitter, and then tried to cover it up by blaming {w|hackers} for posting the picture, denying all responsibility.Weiner later admitted sending online messages to other women, including to a 17-year-old high school student in Delaware, though a police investigation uncovered nothing illegal. On Wednesday, a former {w|porn actress} revealed that she had engaged in an online relationship with Weiner and that Weiner had asked her to lie about the nature of their contact. More photos have continued to emerge, including one showing his nude genitals, and others showing him half naked. On Wednesday, the {w|National Enquirer} published images of Weiner {w|cross-dressing} while he was a college student at the {w|State University of New York at Plattsburgh}. In one photo, he is seen wearing a bra and pantyhose, while in another he is oiled and wearing swimming trunks.Colleagues  said Weiner wanted to wait for the return home of his wife, Abedin, before making a final career decision. He has been married for almost a year to Abedin, who is pregnant with the couple's first child. She is a top aide to Hillary Clinton, the {w|US Secretary of State|Secretary of State}, and the couple's wedding was presided over by former President Bill Clinton. She returned home to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning after having traveled with Clinton in the Middle East and Africa since June 8. Weiner's district covers parts of {w|Brooklyn} and {w|Queens}, boroughs of New York City. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of New York City in 2005, and he was considered a potential candidate for future races. Known to be an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, he has irked conservatives and Democratic leaders. In 2009, he pushed for government-run health care, even though Obama had opposed the idea.== Sources ==

Running a principled U.S. Congressional Campaign which was based upon the {w|United States Constitution|Constitution} and the {W|Liberty|anchor=Philosophy|Philosophy of Liberty} and which NEVER personally attacked my opponent but engaged him rigorously on policy and the issues. Getting up, when Life knocks me down.         Every single Soldier, Sailor, Airperson, Marine, Doctor and/or Nurse who has fought with honor to defend the Republic, even if I will never know all their names, as well as their spouses who supported them in that endeavor. Every person -- great and not -- who has struggled for the full equality of the body politic. First among these for me are {w|Leonidas I|King Leonidas}, {w|Pericles} , {w|Jesus Christ|Jesus}, {w|Cicero}, {w|Pelagius}, {w|Galileo Galilei}, {w|Leonardo Da Vinci}, {w|Sir Isaac Newton}, {w|John Locke}, {w|Voltaire}, {w|George Washington}, {w|Thomas Jefferson}, {w|Alexander Hamilton}, {w|Benjamin Franklin}, {w|John Adams}, {w|Thomas Paine}, {w|John Paul Jones}, {w|Fr¨¦d¨¦ric Bastiat|Fredric Bastiat}, {w|Abraham Lincoln}, {w|Fredrick Douglass}, {w|Robert Gould Shaw|Col.

Jill Barnes, and Jennifer R. Harris.      This pursuit led me to Ron Paul and the discovery of Libertarianism. I will never again vote for any candidate based upon their party affiliation. What will now and forever dominate my decision is a candidate's demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty.  Thus has the time come for candidates running on our Founders' Platform to rise up, proud of the political lineage whose generations' long aim has been the complete equality of the body politic, yet humble and weary of how prejudice undermines that legacy as well as the Philosophy of Liberty itself. Giving in to socialism will not erase the moral mistakes of the past, but it will return our children to the states of slavery and involuntary servitude against which we have so long struggled. I articulate bold policy positions, as well as the means to institute them, based upon the Philosophy of Liberty and the Constitution with the aim of restoring Freedom, Liberty and the Republic. This is the definition of political courage, as taking these strong positions makes me a target for the bullets and blows of the enemies of Liberty. But we are in the fight of our age and we must have champions willing to trade blows with the enemy, not merely repeat Libertarian platitudes.  Educational campaigns have been the mainstay of the Libertarian Party since its founding; but if we are going to take that next step ¡ª to actually convince the body politic that we can put into policy that which we preach, then we must nominate a candidate who is not afraid step out, armed with the courage of conviction and lead on every issue. Of course our ability to do this is tied to cogent articulation of the philosophy which underlies our political ideology, but for too long have our other candidates engaged in academic debates for their own sake, and not actually deigned to apply that for which they argue to that which they will do. That being said, the biggest thing that separates me from my Libertarian Colleagues is that I am not running this race merely to educate or to increase the Party's ballot access; I am running to win and I believe with all my heart that we can be -- and that we must be -- victorious.   These charges are made manifest by appeal to some of the very same made by the Founders of this Republic against the {w|List of English monarchs|King of England} for promulgating some of the same tyrannies which are now being foisted upon We the People by our own federal government. To enumerate only a few levied by the {w|United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence} our federal government has 1. "¡­erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance." 2. "¡­kept among us, in Times of Peace, [and at our expense] standing Armies¡­" 3. "¡­combined with others [NATO and the United Nations] to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving [its] Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation." 4. "¡­[cut]off our Trade with all Parts of the World [for products or services with which the elected majority finds disfavor]" 5. "¡­[imposed] taxes upon us without our consent [by way of deficit spending which will have to be repaid by those not yet old enough to vote]" 6. "¡­suspended {w|Habeas Corpus} and deprived "¡­us in many Cases of the Benefits of Trial by Jury [{w|USA PATRIOT Act|The Patriot Act} and {w|Guantanamo Bay detention camp|GITMO}] 7. "¡­[taken] away our Charters, [abolished] our most valuable Laws, and [altered] fundamentally the Forms of our Governments" [this referring to the federal government's many infringements of out states' sovereignty] 8. "¡­[declared] themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in [nearly] all Cases whatsoever" [by way of gross misuse of the {w|Commerce Clause}, the {w|Supremacy Clause|Supremacy Clauses} as well as many others to pass, sign and uphold onerous legislation which would never be countenanced by a free People] 9. waged the {w|War on Drugs|Drug} and {w|War on Terror|Terror} "¡­War against us [and in so doing] has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burned [or seized] our [property], [invaded our privacy, killed citizens attempting to defend their property, sexually assaulted women and children attempting to travel] and destroyed the Lives of our People.""In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms [by begging for the cessation of: bailouts, social welfares, undeclared foreign Wars, {w|No taxation without representation|taxation without representation} and the devaluation of our Wealth, the theft and destruction of our Property along with the killing and incarceration of our People, the sexual assault of our Women and Children in the name of security, the gross infringements of our Privacy ]: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury [after TARP came bailouts for a host of corporations, the social welfares are too numerous to list, the War in Libya goes on despite its gross unconstitutionality as does the {w|War in Afghanistan|War in Afghanistan} despite having met the objectives contained in the Letter of Reprisal authorizing our actions there, the debt limit is about to be raised once again, the {w|Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve} continues its {W|quantitative easing}, the Civil War on Drugs rages on despite the previous failure of prohibition and trillions spent to curb private behavior in the name of morality all to no avail, the sexual assaults being perpetrated by the TSA continue despite several state legislatures attempting to nullify them, the Patriot Act was just extended and all of this despite most of these actions not having the approval of the VAST majority of the People]. A Prince [or central Government] whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People." It should be clear then by the enumeration of this "long Train of Abuses and Usurpations," which represents but a tiny fraction of the same which our central government is using to pursue "invariably the same Object" and that it "evinces a Design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism." Thus by the precedent established by the Declaration of Independence, and the Founding of the Republic itself under similar, if not even less trying circumstances, that it is the Right and Duty of We the People to use the political process still available to us to "throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for [our] future Security" as well as restore our Constitution and our Republic. As a potential Candidate for the Libertarian Party's Presidential Nomination I would encourage the People to begin this restorative political process by electing to the Office of President the MOST Constitutionally Libertarian Candidate available and to continue it by doing the same in the election of all future federal representatives to the Congress REGARDLESS of their perceived political experience. For certainly it is the case that nearly every single member of all three branches of the federal government are very experienced career politicians and yet the state of our Republic and the condition of our Freedom and Liberty are worse off now that they have been at any time since our founding.                I will deploy the {w|United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals} backed up by the {W|US National Guard|National Guard} to protect Border State property owners from violent cross-border organized crime enterprises and syndicates. 
[[Study says young stars 'shoot water bullets']]According to Dutch astronomers at {w|Leiden University|Leiden University}, a distant star is "shooting" water bullets into space. Astronomers say the amount of water released from the young sun-like {w|Protostar|Protostar} is 100 million times what the {w|Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Rainforest} produces every second. "If we picture these jets as giant hoses and the water droplets as bullets, the amount shooting out equals a hundred million times the water flowing through the Amazon River every second. We are talking about velocities reaching {km to mi |200000|spell} per hour, which is about 80 times faster than bullets flying out of a machine gun," said lead scientist and author of the study, Lars Kristensen.The discovery was made by the {w|Herschel Space Observatory}, of the European Space Agency. The astronomers studied the lights of particles they saw while looking through the clouds of a young star in the constellation {w|Perseus|Perseus}, about 750 {w|Light-year|light years} from earth. Both oxygen and hydrogen atoms were detected and are believed to be created inside the star. When the drops of water are pushed out by the star's gases, they are released as a superheated steam, before they are cooled by the surrounding space, just enough to condense them into water."We are only now beginning to understand that sunlike stars probably all undergo a very energetic phase when they are young," added Kristensen. "It's at this point in their lives when they spew out a lot of high-velocity material¡ªpart of which we now know is water."== Sources ==

[[UN passes LGBT rights resolution]]South Africa proposed the resolution, which calls for a report on global discrimination based upon sexual orientation and announces "grave concern at acts of violence and discrimination, in all regions of the world, committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation and gender identity." "The resolution before us today does not seek to impose values on other states," said South African delegate Jerry Matthews Matjila, presenting his nation's proposal on the final day of the council's latest eighteen-day session. "It seeks to initiate a dialogue which will contribute to us ending discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity."The European Union, United States, and Latin American nations including Brazil agreed. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Russia were among the opposition; five members did not take either side ¡ª China, Burkina Faso, and Zambia entered abstentions, Kyrgyzstan failed to vote and Libya is suspended.Nigerian delegate Ositadinma Anaedu said, "We are dealing with a matter that falls outside of human rights," and Pakistani Shafqat Ali Khan said on the {W|Organisation of the Islamic Conference}'s behalf "We are seriously concerned at the attempt to introduce to the United Nations some notions that have no legal foundation in any international human rights instrument."Amnesty International rejected this notion. "The principle of non-discrimination and equal protection of the law applies even to people who are excluded sometimes based on their sexual orientation and gender identity," Whitney Brown said for the organisation. "You can see [the resolution] as an authoritative interpretation of binding treaty law, which does prohibit discrimination." Amnesty claims 76 nations prohibit same-sex relationships.South Africa was accused by other African nations of failing to support its neighbours in favour of Western nations. A Mauritanian diplomat alleged the resolution seeks "to replace the natural rights of a human being with an unnatural right." South Africa is the first nation to specifically address sexual discrimination in its constitution, which was written in the 1990s.The review of anti-LGBT discrimination is anticipated to be over by the year's end.== Sources == 
[[Massive flooding in China; over 550 thousand evacuated]]Heavy June rainfall has forced China to  evacuate more than 550,000 people from their homes. Massive floods have devastated the central and  southern parts of the country,  causing rivers to overflow their banks and triggering mudslides.  The rains follow the worst {w|drought} in China in over 50 years, which has decimated  crop yields.  Overall, 40 rivers have risen above safe limits, stressing  dykes and dams including those on China's largest waterway, the {w|Yangtze|Yangtze River}, which is flooding downstream while experiencing a severe drought near its source in the north. China's disaster level has been raised to four, the highest on the scale. In a statement on its website on Friday, China's {w|Ministry of Civil Affairs} said, "Since June 13, the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to ... the emergency evacuation of 671,200 people to safety."The current round of heavy rains began in early June. Since then, more than a million and a half people have been displaced in  the central and southern regions of the country and at least 168 deaths have been reported. Meteorologists in {w|Beijing} are predicting more heavy rain in  {w|Sichuan}, {w|Guizhou}, and {w|Zhejiang} this weekend.The government has mobilized its forces to aid in the massive evacuations. According to {w|Reuters}, local authorities are distributing a box of {w|instant noodles} and a carton of bottled water to those affected by the flood. But villagers have reported that survival is difficult, especially for those still trapped by the flood waters in small villages, and distribution of aid is slow, with some not receiving any. A villager was quoted by Reuters: "To be frank, those rescue boats cannot go through those narrow lanes inside the village. A lot of them depend on their relatives rowing small wooden boats to get to them... It is hard to help these people inside there." Another villager, Shou Pengfei  said, "Some did not even get any relief items. There is no electricity and you get bitten by mosquitoes all the time." According to  the Beijing Climate Centre, weather trends have shifted drastically. Currently the  rain is coming in shorter but fiercer bursts, with  protracted periods of drought in between the torrential rain. The heavy  rainfall is not likely to reduce the crop failure caused by months of drought, especially in the north, the heart of China's grain-growing bread basket, where many rivers have dried up. According to reports, the northern countryside  has been left devastated by the droughts. Huge dams hundreds of meters wide are now small, muddy pools. Large cities such as {w|Beijing} are draining the underground water sources and China is facing a long-term water crisis.Meanwhile, China is engaged in  a huge multi-year engineering project designed to move water to the parched north and away from the flooded south. The North-South water project is a massive series of canals and pipes designed to carry water from the Yangtze and {w|Yellow River|Yellow} rivers to Beijing.It is likely, analysts predict, that Chinese crop shortages will increase food prices worldwide. Even before the latest flooding, the severe drought in the north caused a  shortfall in China's crop yields that will likely  affect the price of wheat and may propel a price increase in global markets.== Sources == 
[[South Korean troops mistakenly attack passenger jet]]Troops in South Korea attacked a passenger jet Saturday after mistaking it for a North Korean aircraft. The {W|Asiana Airlines} plane was out of range and escaped undamaged; the 119 on board were unharmed.Soldiers fired 99 rounds, including two blanks, from their {W|Daewoo Precision Industries K2|K2 rifles} at the {W|Airbus A320 family|Airbus A321} as it approached {W|Incheon International Airport} on a flight from China. That airport serves Seoul and is 25 miles from the border between the two Korean states.The plane's route is disputed. One aviation controller said that the plane was "flying normally" and "did not deviate from its normal route," a claim with which Asiana agrees. However, {W|Yonhap} reports that the South Korean marines who attacked the aircraft say it was off-course. A Marine Corps official said the shooting lasted ten minutes as the plane flew over {W|Jumun} island. The marines fired from nearby {W|Gyodong}.Relations between the two Korean countries have been tense since the end of open hostilities in the 1953 {W|Korean War}. The South Korean military has recently used photos of North Korean leader {W|Kim Jong Il}'s family for target practice, with the north threatening retaliation. South Korean media claimed yesterday that the south has US-built missiles capable of reaching the northern capital, Pyongyang, and blamed the north for twin bombings that killed 50 people last year.One current dispute involves nine refugees arriving in the south by boat on June 11. Yesterday, the south said that all wish to defect and, per its policy, refused to hand them back. The north's {W|Red Cross} warned on Thursday that failure to do so could lead to further deterioration in Korean relations.South Korean troops have been told by Defence Minister {W|Kim Kwan-Jin} to fire at attacking North Koreans without waiting for or seeking instructions. "Don't ask your commanders whether to fire back or not. Take actions first and then report afterwards," he said on the front line in March. The South Korean military was criticised in November for a slow response to the north's shelling of {W|Yeonpyeong} island, which killed four.The two marines who attacked the plane yesterday had recently been told that the North was increasing military action due to heightened tensions. As a result of the incident, increased training on aircraft identification will be performed. Asiana said they were unaware of the attack until contacted by the military and asked if the jet had been hit.
[[US Food and Drug Administration proposes new regulations on sunscreen labeling]]The US {w|Food and Drug Administration} has proposed new regulations, set to come into effect next year, to clarify sunscreen labels regarding the product's effectiveness against {w|ultraviolet} rays. The regulations, which the FDA has been considering since 1978, would prohibit claims that a sunscreen is "waterproof" or "sweatproof", since the FDA believes these terms are misleading. Instead, the word "water-resistant" must be used, and the label must specify how long the product lasts in water. Sunscreens that are not water-resistant must include a warning.Only sunscreens that protect against both UV-A and UV-B rays could be labeled "broad spectrum". Currently, the SPF reflects protection against only UVB, not UVA. If the SPF is less than 15, then the label also must warn the consumer that the product is less effective at protecting against skin cancer or sunburn. Labels would not be able to claim an SPF higher than 50, since there is little evidence that suggests that anything higher offers significantly better protection against UV. Dermatologist Dr. Neil Korman supports this regulation, saying that it would reduce consumers' inclination towards buying products with unnecessarily high SPFs.The FDA is also investigating the safety of aerosol-spray sunscreen, until more is known about its effects on breathing. The {w|Environmental Working Group} warns that the spray could cause lung damage. The EWG also discourages the use of sunscreens with bug repellant, and recommends practices that avoid substantial exposure to UV rays. == Sources == 
[[Clarence Clemons, Springsteen¡¯s E Street Band sax player, dies at 69]]Called the "Big Man" because of his 6-foot 5-inch frame, Clemons joined Springteen's  New Jersey band in 1972. For all but two years, he was the only black in the largely white, working class group, and became a key influence in Springsteen's music as well as a trusted companion. He was a jovial on-stage presence and musically added to the band's electric guitar sound and strong rhythms. According to the New York Times, he added "muscular, melodic saxophone {w|Hook|hooks} that echoed {w|doo-wop}, {w|Soul music|soul} and early {w|Rock and roll|rock ¡¯n¡¯ roll}".  His rollicking saxophone solos were a signature sound for the E Street Band on songs such as {w|Jungleland},  and {w|Born To Run}.He also released several solo albums and played with other bands and artists.  He was featured on {w|Aretha Franklin}'s {w|Freeway of Love} and duetted with {w|Jackson Browne} on {w|You're a Friend of Mine}. Most recently, he played on {w|Lady Gaga}'s latest album, {w|Born This Way}. Additionally, he occasionally acted, appearing in such movies as {w|Martin Scorsese}'s {w|New York, New York|New York, New York} and various TV shows including {w|Diff¡¯rent Strokes}. He famously jammed with  President Bill Clinton at his first inaugural ball in 1993. Clemons was born in {w|Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk}, Virginia on Jan. 11, 1942 and grew up in a religious environment, immersed in {w|gospel music}. He was drawn to  rock ¡¯n¡¯ roll and received an {w|alto saxophone|alto sax} as a Christmas gift when he was nine, but soon fell under the  influence of {w|King Curtis} and moved to the {w|Tenor saxophone|tenor sax}. He said in an interview: "I got into the soul music, but I wanted to rock. I was a rocker. I was a born rock 'n' roll sax player."Clemons was also a talented athlete and received a college scholarship for football and music, but he injured his knee in a car accident, ending any chances for a professional football career. Springsteen said in a statement: "Clarence lived a wonderful life. He carried within him a love of people that made them love him.  He created a wondrous and extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage. His loss is immeasurable and we are honored and thankful to have known him and had the opportunity to stand beside him for nearly forty years. He was my great friend, my partner and with Clarence at my side, my band and I were able to tell a story far deeper than those simply contained in our music.  His life, his memory, and his love will live on in that story and in our band."== Sources == 
[[Soviet human rights activist Yelena Bonner dies aged 88]]Bonner gained fame by smuggling the papers of her late husband,  the nuclear physicist and Russian dissident {w|Andrei Sakharov}, out of {w|Siberia} and was prominent in her own right for her human rights activism.  Leaders and politicians  paid Bonner tribute. "The world has lost one of the most inspiring and dedicated human rights defenders," said {w|Jerzy Buzek}, {w|President of the European Parliament|President} of the  {w|European Parliament}.Bonner was born in  Turkmenistan  February 15, 1923 to a family of {w|Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party} officials; her father was later killed and her mother sent to a {w|gulag} in  {w|Joseph Stalin}'s {w|Great Purge|purges} of the late 1930s. In  1941, she became  a nurse for the Soviet military on the front during World War II. She suffered a severe wound to the chest, and serious head injuries in 1943 from which she nearly lost her sight, and received decorations for valor.  Bonner returned to the front in 1945, advancing with the army to {w|Potsdam}. While studying medicine when the war was over, she married a fellow student, Ivan Semyonov and they had a son and a daughter. But as she became increasingly politically active, they lost their common interests and divorced in 1965. She was an active Soviet dissident  in the 1970s, and a leader of a group that monitored Soviet compliance with the {w|Helsinki Accords}. The Washington Post describes her at this time as "[h]eadstrong and sharp-tongued with a no-nonsense voice deepened by years of chain-smoking acrid Russian cigarettes".Bonner married Sakharov in 1972, whom she had met through her political activities. He  was also fierce critic of the lack of civil liberties and human rights in the {w|Soviet Union}, and their tiny Moscow apartment became the meeting place for the Soviet dissident movement in the 1970s. They traveled around Russia together visiting imprisoned dissidents and working for their legal rights.When Sakharov  won  the {w|Nobel Peace Prize} in 1975, she traveled to {w|Oslo} to receive it on his behalf as Soviet authorities refused to allow her husband to leave the country.Sakharove was arrested in 1980 and exiled to  Siberia, and Bonner, Sakharove's sole contact with the outside world, smuggled  his writings to Moscow and ensured that they were published. Soviet authorities conducted campaigns of personal attacks against her, accusing her of being a foreign agent who turned Sakharove against his country. In 1984 she was convicted of "anti-Soviet agitation" and was exiled to Siberia with her husband, both continually  harassed by authorities. She published her memoir in 1986 of the years in exile, described by the Washington Post as partly "a love story of mutual sacrifice."In 1986  {w|Mikhail Gorbachev} allowed the Sakharoves to return to Moscow  where they continued to agitate for human rights and were constantly harassed for their activities. When the {w|Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed} two years after  Sakharov's death in 1989, Bonner continued her human rights and  political activities. She initially supported President {w|Boris Yeltsin}'s government and served on his state human rights commission, but became critical of his government at the beginning of the {w|First Chechen War|war in Chechnya}. She was also critical of Yeltin's successor, {w|Vladimir  Putin}, and was the first person to sign a petition against him in March 2010. As her health deteriorated, she became less active, and she moved to the United States to be with her daughter.Bonner received the {w|Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize|Rafto Prize} in 1991 for her promotion of human rights in the former Soviet Union and in contemporary Russia.  She published at least four books and edited her husband's memoirs which were published in 1997.== Sources ==

[[UN report says 80 per cent of world's refugees live in poor countries]]Reflecting an  "overwhelming imbalance", the  majority  of the  world's {w|Displaced person|forcibly displaced refugees} have been taken in by poor, {w|developing countries}, not  industrialized countries, according to the  2010 Global Trends report by the United Nations {w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|High Commissioner for Refugees} released on Monday. The report states that many of the poorest countries in the world have accommodated the largest numbers of refugees in absolute terms and also in proportion to their economies.There were 43.7 million people  displaced worldwide at the end of 2010, according to the report, more than half children.  UNHCR works in over 120 countries and includes both refugees forced to flee a country  as well as those forced out of areas in their own country. The global total is broken down into the following categories: 15.4 million {w|refugee|refugees}, 27.5 million internally displaced people, and another 840,000 people awaiting to be assigned to {w|Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|refugee status}. In addition, there are an  estimated 12 million {w|Statelessness|stateless people} around the world; people who lack even the basic identity  of a nationality. Since 2004, the  reported numbers of  stateless populations has steadily increased.According to the report, Pakistan's 1.9 million refugee population is the largest, followed by  Iran with 1.1 million and Syria with 1 million. The neighboring nations of Afghanistan and Iraq accounted for the largest number of people fleeing.The report states: "Pakistan also has the biggest economic impact with 710 refugees for each US dollar of its per capita {w|Gross Domestic Product}, followed by Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya with 475 and 247 refugees respectively. By comparison, Germany, the industrialized country with the largest refugee population, has 17 refugees for each dollar of per capita GDP."The new report depicts a very different situation than  when the UN refugee agency was founded in 1950 to deal with the  2.1 million Europeans displaced by {w|World War Two}. And it comes at a time when anti-refugee feelings are increasing in many industrialized countries."Fears about supposed floods of refugees in industrialized countries are being vastly overblown or mistakenly conflated with issues of migration. Meanwhile, it's poorer countries that are left having to pick up the burden", said {w|Ant¨®nio Guterres}, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.UNHCR UK spokesman Mans Nyberg called for greater urgency in conflict resolution: "We are also concerned with the 7m people in protracted situations who are living in camps for more than 10 years, sometimes even 30 years. We are really appealing to the international community to put more efforts into conflict resolution so that these situations can be resolved."The report notes that in  2010 Japan resettled 18 families from Myanmar, becoming the first Asian country to accept refugees.The large number of people that fled Libya, C?te d'Ivoire and Syria in 2011, were not tallied in the report.== Sources ==

[[Greek parliament votes in favor of new Papandreou cabinet as debt crisis deepens]]Greek Prime Minister {w|George Papandreou} survived a confidence vote by the Greek parliament late Tuesday night, thus allowing Papandreou to form a new cabinet  constituted to address Greece's severe financial debt crisis.  The vote's outcome is viewed as a measure of confidence in  the government's ability to resolve the problems of the {w|Economy_of_Greece#2010-2011_debt_crisis|deeply-indebted nation} and  implement the stringent austerity measures  necessary for Greece to receive future {w|bailout} packages from the European Union. Papandreou managed to face down internal dissent within his own {w|Panhellenic Socialist Movement} over the extremely unpopular austerity measures and the final vote of 155 to 143, with two abstentions, matched Papandreou's 155 seats. Meanwhile, Greeks were angrily demonstrating  against the measures outside, throwing bottles at the parliament building as riot police stood by.Following the confidence vote, Greece will be in a position to look for  further financial aid from the EU to avoid  {w|Sovereign default|defaulting} on its enormous debt, but help from the EU is dependent on the real work that must be done first: the Greek parliament's implementation of the hugely unpopular austerity measures.Government spokesman Elias Mossialos said in an interview with {W|Skai TV|Skai Television} before the vote that Greece will be unable to pay wages and pensions after July 15 if the government does not secure the EU financing.   The vote came in the midst weeks of widespread anti-austerity protests and strikes in major cities throughout Greece, involving clashes between police and demonstrators angry with the proposed slew of layoffs in the public sector which are to accompany the Socialist cabinet's program. On Wednesday, {w|Pimco}, the biggest bond fund in the world, said it was unimpressed with Tuesday's vote of confidence, saying it believes Greece and perhaps other European economies will  ultimately default on their debts. {w|Mohamed A. El-Erian|Mohamed El-Erian}, chief executive of Pimco, said, "Nothing has been done to enhance growth. No single indicator has shown strength." "For the next three years, we're going to see different economies work out different problems. For European economies, especially Greece, it would be through {w|Sovereign default|default}," said Mohamed El-Erian  in a video conference.The euro fell against the dollar on Wednesday as financial markets indicated that the {w|European sovereign debt crisis|eurozone debt crisis} is far from over.George Papandreou gave an emotional speech to  parliament on Wednesday, saying "We have a unique opportunity. If we falter, if we lose heart and squander it... history will judge us very harshly." Meanwhile, when the new austerity measures move to parliament for a vote,  Greece's major unions are planning to hold a 48-hour general strike.== Sources == 
[[Brazil spots unknown tribe of indigenous people in Amazon jungle]]Brazil has located an isolated group of {w|indigenous peoples|indigenous}, {w|uncontacted peoples|uncontacted people}  in the Brazilian {w|Amazon rainforest}, the {w|Funda??o Nacional do ?ndio|Brazilian National Foundation of Indians} announced today.FUNAI, a state agency, uses aerial expeditions to avoid impacting uncontacted people and invading their land. The agency's policy is to avoid maintaining any human contact with untouched tribes.Clearings in the {w|Vale do Javari|Javari river valley} reservation were first identified by satellite; the group's existence was only verified later by air flights over the area. The flights established the existence of three clearings with four straw-roofed buildings, known as {w|maloca}s, which may shelter over 200 Indians. Also visible were areas where  crops such as bananas,  maize and perhaps peanuts were apparently being grown.FUNAI's Javari valley coodinator told the Brazilian news agency Estado that both the croplands and the malocas "are new" and are estimated to have been used "for at most one year". Amorim said, "[T]he Amazon region contains the majority of untouched tribes without any contact with the exterior in the World." And he said the recent findings highlight that the Javari valley holds, "the greatest concentration of isolated groups in {w|Amazon rainforest|Amazonia}".The newly identified group is located close to Brazil's border with Peru in the huge {w|Vale do Javari} reservation.   Fourteen known uncontacted tribes have been spotted there and up to eight more are suggested by aerial evidence. Altogether, there are about 2,000 individuals in the reservation, according to Amorim. He said that their culture and their very  survival is threatened by illegal removal of the area's natural resources, as well as many other intrusions of civilization, but  most of Brazil's indigenous groups have not changed their languages or  traditions. FUNAI estimates that the recently discovered tribe likely belongs to the {w|Panoan languages|pano language} group.Brazil's indigenous peoples have tenaciously fought for their legal right to reclaim their traditional lands which were allotted to them in  {w|Constitution of Brazil|Brazil's 1988 constitution} stating that all indigenous ancestral lands were to have their boundaries clearly marked  and returned to tribes within five years.== Sources == 
[[Prohibition Party holds convention; nominates Jack Fellure for U.S. President]]Retired West Virginia engineer {w|Jack Fellure|Lowell Jackson "Jack" Fellure} won the {w|President of the United States|presidential} nomination of the {w|Prohibition Party} yesterday at the party's National Convention in {w|Cullman, Alabama|Cullman}, Alabama. He won on the second ballot, defeating {w|Thompson Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania|Thompson Township} tax accessor {w|James Hedges} of Pennsylvania, who initially ran unopposed. Party Chairman Toby Davis of Mississippi received the {w|vice presidential} nomination.The Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the United States, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late 19th century. As its name suggests, the party heavily supported the {w|Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution}, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the US period known as {w|Prohibition}. The party has declined since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, but has continued to nominate candidates for the presidential election.Fellure, 79, has run for president in every election since {w|United States presidential election, 1988|1988}, though usually as a {w|Republican Party|Republican}. This run marks his first as a member of the Prohibition Party. On his campaign website, he cites the {w|Authorized King James Version|Authorized 1611 King James Bible} as his presidential platform, and calls for the teaching of the Bible in public schools, criminalization of {w|homosexuality}, and the elimination of {w|abortion}, the {w|Alcohol industry|liquor industry} and {w|pornography}. On economics, he supports reducing taxes and balancing the federal budget.Hedges, the first Prohibition Party member elected to public office since 1959, announced his campaign in February 2010, and was the only candidate until last month. According to Vice Chairman June Griffin: "While Jim has contributed valuable resources to this Party...his positions regarding Environmentalism and passivity toward war forced me to vote for Jack Fellure. As well, his insistence on a moratorium on the building of nuclear plants caused much unrest among the membership. Yet he prevailed to install this plank." The ten voting Prohibition Party convention delegates and a few guests met for the National Convention, which began on Monday at the {w|Holiday Inn Express} in Cullman. Tuesday featured a short greeting from Cullman Mayor Max Townson, followed by addresses from Libertarian consultant {w|Stephen P. Gordon}, {w|Ballot Access News} publisher {w|Richard Winger}, and Eunie Smith of the {w|Eagle Forum}.Gordon, who previously worked as the e-Campaign manager for the {w|Bob Barr presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Bob Barr presidential campaign}, jokingly commented that his speech "stunk". He opened his address with the joke that "the way to pick out the libertarian at a Prohibition Party function is that I¡¯m the one wearing the {w|Jerry Garcia} tie." He discussed how third party candidates could utilize {w|new media} to their advantage, but avoided any ideological topics.Winger, an expert on election law, discussed {w|ballot access} and the history of the Prohibition Party. He notably explained how the party had cost the Republicans presidential victories in the elections of {w|United States presidential election, 1884|1884} and {w|United States presidential election, 1916|1916}, which forestalled the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment by Republicans, who wanted to do away with the alcohol issue. Gordon later commented that Winger's speech was well-received by the audience.After Winger's speech, the convention broke for lunch. Afterwards, Smith, the widow of former Congressman {w|Albert L. Smith, Jr.}, focused on immigration and education in her address. When asked about the Eagle Forum's participation in the fight against alcohol, she commented that the group was focused on more pressing issues such as gambling.After the nomination, some party members traveled to the grave of {w|Sidney Catts} in Florida. Catts, who died in 1936, was the first and only state governor elected from the Prohibition Party. The party will now begin ballot access drives in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, New Jersey, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee and Arkansas. In {w|United States presidential election, 2008|2008}, the late {w|Gene Amondson} appeared on the ballot in Colorado, Florida and Louisiana and picked up a total of 653 votes. == Sources ==

[[Libyan rebels in Misrata restrict press freedoms]]Rebel authorities in the Libyan city of Misrata have begun implementing tighter restrictions on foreign journalists in the city this week, in response to fears that spies for President Muammar al-Gaddafi may be among them.Under the new restrictions, reporters have been barred from traveling to the front lines of the conflict, denied access to high-speed internet links and ordered to use translators approved by Misratan officials.  Additionally, reporters accredited by the rebel government based in Benghazi, the {w|National Transitional Council}, are no longer recognized as such by local officials and are required to register with Misrata authorities or face deportation.According to Mohammed Durat, an official in charge of the Misrata media center, the changes have come about because authorities "are afraid of spies from Gaddafi."  He also said that the new restrictions are intended to benefit reporters, saying that "[w]e are caring about you, we don't want you to get any bad thing" and that "[y]ou should be happy about this."Morale in Misrata has fallen in recent weeks, after rebel forces have failed to expand the area they control after a month of fighting and are suffering increasing casualties. In the urban areas, after a month of reletive calm, pro-Gaddafi forces have again begun shelling buildings, with minimal response from NATO forces, despite a declaration on June 14 that NATO helicopter strikes would be carried out if civilian targets were attacked.== Sources == 
[[Obama announces troop reductions in Afghanistan]]A third of U.S. forces in Afghanistan are to be withdrawn from the country by the end of next year, president Barack Obama has announced. In a televised statement on Wednesday evening, Obama announced 33,000 soldiers would be withdrawn from the country by the summer of next year, and declared the U.S. had beaten al-Qaeda and the Taliban.During the speech he announced the U.S. was "meeting our goals" to reverse the momentum of the Taliban and train the {w|Afghan National Army}, and said al-Qaeda was "on a path to defeat" after the death of Osama bin Laden earlier this year. Obama said that it was "time to focus on nation-building here at home," and that the reduction in troops marked "the beginning¡ªbut not the end¡ªof our effort to wind down this war."U.S. civilian leaders from both the {w|Democratic party|Democratic} and {w|Republican party|Republican} parties have voiced support for a rapid drawdown of troops¡ª27 senators from both parties sent a letter to the president last week advocating "a sizable and sustained reduction in forces." However, politicians are also angry at the huge cost of the war¡ªcurrently over {w|USD|$}2bn every week¡ªand the U.S. public is tired of the war which has gone on ten years, leaving thousands of Americans dead.However, NATO officials are worried the president is making a big gamble with such a large scale withdrawal, and have warned the U.S. could take substantial losses in the country as "{w|fighting season}" begins into the summer. Analysts say any setbacks in the country this year will leave Obama exposed to allegations he was too quick in his decision and was too politically motivated.== Sources == 
[[Nebraska's two nuclear plants near Omaha on alert]]Two nuclear power plants in Nebraska, US, near the city of {W|Omaha}, remain on alert following flooding. One is shut down pending floodwater receding.The {w|Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station|Fort Calhoun nuclear reactor} - 19 miles north from Omaha - has been shut down since April 9 partly due to flooding from the {W|Missouri River}. It sits nearly two feet below the current river level. This month, the plant lost power needed to cool the {W|spent fuel pool} for a short time after a fire. The current flooding with record water releases is expected to stay at high levels until August, so that another plant, {w|Cooper Nuclear Station}, to the south and further from Omaha, will soon be concerned, too.On Wednesday the {W|U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission} said that it was keeping an eye on the situation and both plants have taken action for protection against the rising floodwaters.
[[Ryan Dunn twice over drink-drive limit at time of fatal accident]]Televison star {w|Ryan Dunn} was twice over the legal {w|drink-drive limit} at the time of last Monday's car accident that killed him and a friend. The pair died when Dunn's {w|Porsche} left the road and crashed into a tree causing the car to burst into flames. Police have determined that the vehicle was travelling at speeds between 132 and 140 mph.The accident occurred in West Chester, Pennsylvania where the legal drink drive limit is a blood alcohol reading of 0.08. Toxicology results show that Dunn had a blood alcohol level of 0.196. The star had previously been caught drink-driving in 2005.Dunn made a name for himself after appearing in the television series {w|Jackass}. He starred in the TV series as well as the three follow on films that were produced.

[[Saturn moon Enceladus may have salty ocean]]NASA's {w|Cassini|Cassini¨CHuygens} spacecraft has discovered evidence for a large-scale saltwater reservoir beneath the icy crust of Saturn's moon {w|Enceladus|Enceladus}. The data came from the spacecraft's direct analysis of salt-rich ice grains close to the jets ejected from the moon. The study has been published in this week's edition of the journal {w|Nature|Nature}.Data from Cassini's cosmic dust analyzer show the grains expelled from fissures, known as tiger stripes, are relatively small and usually low in salt far away from the moon. Closer to the moon's surface, Cassini found that relatively large grains rich with sodium and potassium dominate the plumes. The salt-rich particles have an "ocean-like" composition and indicate that most, if not all, of the expelled ice and water vapor comes from the evaporation of liquid salt-water. When water freezes, the salt is squeezed out, leaving pure water ice behind. Cassini's ultraviolet imaging spectrograph also recently obtained complementary results that support the presence of a subsurface ocean. A team of Cassini researchers led by Candice Hansen of the {w|Planetary Science Institute} in {w|Tucson, Arizona|Tucson}, Arizona, measured gas shooting out of distinct jets originating in the moon's south polar region at five to eight times the speed of sound, several times faster than previously measured. These observations of distinct jets, from a 2010 flyby, are consistent with results showing a difference in composition of ice grains close to the moon's surface and those that made it out to the E ring, the outermost ring that gets its material primarily from Enceladean jets. If the plumes emanated from ice, they should have very little salt in them."There currently is no plausible way to produce a steady outflow of salt-rich grains from solid ice across all the tiger stripes other than salt water under Enceladus's icy surface," said Frank Postberg, a Cassini team scientist at the {w|University of Heidelberg} in {w|Germany}.The data suggests a layer of water between the moon's rocky core and its icy mantle, possibly as deep as about 50 miles beneath the surface. As this water washes against the rocks, it dissolves salt compounds and rises through fractures in the overlying ice to form reserves nearer the surface. If the outermost layer cracks open, the decrease in pressure from these reserves to space causes a plume to shoot out. Roughly 400 pounds of water vapor is lost every second in the plumes, with smaller amounts being lost as ice grains. The team calculates the water reserves must have large evaporating surfaces, or they would freeze easily and stop the plumes."We imagine that between the ice and the ice core there is an ocean of depth and this is somehow connected to the surface reservoir," added Postberg.The Cassini mission discovered Enceladus' water-vapor and ice jets in 2005. In 2009, scientists working with the cosmic dust analyzer examined some sodium salts found in ice grains of Saturn's E ring but the link to subsurface salt water was not definitive. The new paper analyzes three Enceladus flybys in 2008 and 2009 with the same instrument, focusing on the composition of freshly ejected plume grains. In 2008, Cassini discovered a high "density of volatile gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as organic materials, some 20 times denser than expected" in geysers erupting from the moon. The icy particles hit the detector target at speeds between 15,000 and 39,000 MPH, vaporizing instantly. Electrical fields inside the cosmic dust analyzer separated the various constituents of the impact cloud."Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of the essential building blocks needed for life," said Dennis Matson in 2008, Cassini project scientist at NASA's {w|Jet Propulsion Laboratory} in Pasadena, {w|California}."This finding is a crucial new piece of evidence showing that environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life can be sustained on icy bodies orbiting gas giant planets," said Nicolas Altobelli, the European Space Agency's project scientist for Cassini."If there is water in such an unexpected place, it leaves possibility for the rest of the universe," said Postberg.

This project includes the release of images from RIA's archive to the public under free licenses. During the first phase, one hundred World War II-time photos were uploaded to {w|Wikimedia Commons} under the {w|Creative Commons} share alike license. The license allows the images to be freely used, including within the commercial industry without a fee and allows for creations of derivative works provided any resulting work is redistributed under the same license and properly attributed to its author. The project is supported by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who uploaded one of the images to Wikimedia Commons himself.Medvedev participated in the anniversary ceremony and personally congratulated the agency. He uploaded the 100th image to Commons. Earlier Medvedev supported Wikimedia Russia's position on the need for changes in Russian legislation in order to make free licenses perfectly legal and to allow {W|freedom of panorama} in the country.This event is part of Wikimedia Russia's goal to "share knowledge, eliminate the {W|digital divide} and increase the availability of historical and cultural value for society." Due to similar projects in other countries, German Bundesarchiv released 100,000 historic images under a free license and Queensland State Library released 50,000 images.
[[RIA Novosti Celebrates 70th Anniversary and Makes a Gift to Wikimedia]]While I had told James Hedges by email that I would fully support his candidacy if he was nominated our party's presidential candidate, I will now fully support Jack Fuller. Fuller brings a newness to the Prohibition Party which badly needs new voices and new ideas. Although Fuller is older than most political candidates, his views seem to be the views held by most Prohibitionists and he seems very experienced in the area of campaigning.It is my opinion that the Party Platform actually expresses the Party beliefs much better than the standard bearer. This is true of every political party, including both major parties. So, while some of Fuller's views may seem to be more conservative than those of the Party Platform, it is the Platform which truly expresses Prohibition Party beliefs. We are a Christian Populist party with Progressive/Conservative roots. This can be seen by going to http://www.prohibitionists.org/Background/Party_Platform/Platform_Index.htm and compare with http://www.prohibitionists.org/Background/Party_Platform/party_platform.html You will notice elements of both Progressivism and Conservatism in the same platforms!

[[Former Rwandan government minister Nyiramasuhuko convicted of genocide]]A United Nations court today convicted a woman, a former minister in the Rwandan government, for her role in the {w|1994 genocide} in the ethnic war between the {w|Tutsi} and the {w|Hutu} peoples. Nyiramasuhuko, who was the Rwandan of Minister of Family and Women's Affairs in {W|Juv¨¦nal Habyarimana}'s government in 1994 when about 800,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis were killed, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison today. Her son, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, a {w|militia} leader charged with {w|Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity}, war crimes, and rape, was also convicted and sentenced to life. Four local officials were  found guilty on genocide charges and given prison sentences ranging from 25 years to life.According to prosecutor Holo Makwaia, Nyiramasuhuko intended to "destroy in whole or in part the Tutsi ethnic group in Butare". Following the genocide, she fled Rwanda and was arrested in {W|Nairobi}, Kenya, in 1997.Presiding Judge William Sekule read the judgment: "Many were physically assaulted, raped and taken away to various places in Butare, where they were killed. During the course of these repeated attacks on vulnerable civilians, both Nyiramasuhuko and Ntahobali ordered killings. They also ordered rapes. Ntahobali further committed rapes and Nyiramasuhuko aided and abetted rapes."Nyiramasuhuko is the first woman convicted of genocide by the ICTR, which was established in 1994 after approximately 800,000 Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus were massacred during the genocide.

[[FTC begins antitrust inquiry of Google]]Google has confirmed that it has "received formal notification," that the {w|Federal Trade Commission} is investigating its business practices. The acknowledgment was posted on the internet search engine company's  blog  Friday. Google said it was unclear about the nature of the probe.A broad FTC investigation would cause the company be tied up in defending itself for years, and according to {w|Bloomberg}, might well  be the government¡¯s biggest antitrust case since the Microsoft probe. The FTC will likely launch an  {w|anti-trust} investigation, as the company has been the target of many past smaller ones, according to {w|CNN}. The FCC probe  is expected to determine if Google abuses it market dominance to promote moneymaking {w|Internet marketing|online marketing}, such as  its  mapping, comparison shopping and travel services. According to {w|CNN}, "Google dominates search in the United States, controlling about two-thirds of the market, according to {w|comScore}. It also licenses the world's largest {w|smartphone} operating system, and its share of U.S. {w|display advertising} revenue recently eclipsed long-time leader Yahoo."Google's response is that most complaints of anticompetitive behavior come from companies who are displeased with their ranking in Google's search engine. However, Joshua Wright, law professor at {w|George Mason University} said  the FTC will be looking at possible  harm to users and not complaints by  Google¡¯s competitors. Melissa Maxman, co-chair of a Washington-based, antitrust practice group, said the FTC's {w|Federal Trade Commission|anchor=Bureau of Consumer Protection|Bureau of Consumer Protection unit} will almost certainly be involved to see if Google deceives search engine users by screening search results to profit its own services. She said she would be "shocked" if the consumer protection unit was not involved.  Google Fellow Amit Singhal said in the post, "We respect the FTC's process and will be working with them over the coming months to answer questions about Google and our services." But Singhal acknowledged, "It's still unclear exactly what the FTC's concerns are, but we're clear about where we stand. Since the beginning, we have been guided by the idea that, if we focus on the user, all else will follow." Bloomberg reported Friday: "Google has set aside $500 million for a U.S. government investigation into online pharmacy ads the company accepted that may have violated the law."Google's efforts to improve privacy policies after last years' determination that its social-networking service {w|Google Buzz} used deceptive tactics, are currently being overseen by the FTC.== Sources == 
[[US actor Peter Falk dies aged 83]]US actor {w|Peter Falk} died on Thursday at his home in {w|Beverly Hills}, California after a struggle with {w|Alzheimer's disease}. Falk may be most known for his role as Detective {w|Columbo|Columbo} in the television series of the same name that ran on {w|NBC} from 1968 to 1978, which moved to {w|ABC} in 1989. The last episode aired in 2003. His portrayal of the character won him four {w|Emmy Award}s.Falk, born in 1927, had his right eye surgically removed at the age of three, due to a cancerous growth. He wore a {w|Ocular prosthesis|glass eye} for most of his life. Because of this, he was rejected by the armed services at the end of World War II.Falk starred in his first crime film, {w|Murder, Inc.} in 1960, for which he was nominated for an {w|Academy Award}.

[[American actor Peter Falk dies at 83]]Merchants are advised that they should ensure the cardholder removes their hand from the card during a Chip and PIN transaction, and that there are no wires connecting the card to the cardholder.This simple defence renders Professor Anderson's somewhat convoluted "Backpack Computer" attack ineffective.To date, no mechanism can be demonstrated -- in the laboratory or in the field -- whereby the PIN can be obtained from the cryptogrphically protected area of the chip in which it is held.Therefore the assertion that the technology is not fit for purpose is invalid.There is an easier way to obtain someone's PIN -- look over their shoulder.  So unless the entire concept of entering a "secret number" is deemed invalid, the technology should not be attacked.

Grisanti defended his vote, stating "I cannot deny a person, a human being, a taxpayer, a worker, the same rights I have with my wife". Governor Cuomo referred to the four Republicans as "people of courage and...principle."Gay rights activists, who had spent over $1 million to lobby legislators, cheered the passage, which had failed two years before and had been debated for several weeks. {w|Human Rights Campaign} president {w|Joe Solmonese} exclaimed that "History was made today in New York. This victory sends a message that marriage equality across the country will be a reality very soon." New York City {w|Mayor of New York City|Mayor} {w|Michael Bloomberg} hailed the passage as leaving the state "stronger than we were yesterday".But detractors of the bill reacted differently. Chairwoman {w|Maggie Gallagher} of the {w|National Organization for Marriage} blamed the state Republican Party for the passage and argued that "sadly it's the families of New York who will pay the worst price of the new government-backed redefinition of marriage." The state's {w|Catholic Church} released a statement that commented that the bill "alter[s] radically and forever humanity's historic understanding of marriage [and] leaves us deeply disappointed and troubled".The new law, which will take effect in 30 days, also allows same-sex couples to be eligible for state marriage benefits.
[[Chinese premier Wen Jiabao visits Shakespeare's birthplace]]Chinese {w|Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier} {w|Wen Jiabao} paid a visit to the birthplace of English playwright and poet {w|William Shakespeare} on Sunday. The visit to {w|Stratford-upon-Avon} was included in his three-day tour of various industries in Britain. The UK is one of  China's biggest trading partners, second only to the EU.The 68-year-old Wen, reportedly a fan of Shakespeare, was met upon his arrival at Stratford-upon-Avon by  dozens of flag-waving individuals from the {w|British Chinese|UK's Chinese community}. He  visited Shakespeare's birthplace, which is now a museum and then attended a scene from  Shakespeare's "{w|Hamlet}", his favourite play, while sitting in the "sun-drenched" garden. He toured the collection of treasures  at the town's {w|Shakespeare Birthplace Trust}. On his tour at the Trust, lasting half an hour longer than planned, he looked through a 17th-century folio of Shakespeare's famous  plays. Trust director Diana Owen, who talked with Wen during his informal tour, said Wen described Shakespeare  as "the greatest writer of all time."  Wen told {w|Sky News} that his  love of Shakespeare began as a child."The local people here have every reason to take pride that this place has produced a figure who belongs not only to the UK but to the world," Mr Wen said to Sky News. "A great man who belongs not just to his era but to entire history."The Chinese leader's arrival in England came days after the announcement of activist and dissident sculptor {w|Ai Weiwei}'s release by Beijing last Wednesday, after a global call for his release. The announcement, made before Wen's meeting today with {w|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister} David Cameron, was likely discussed along with the issue of {w|Human rights in the People's Republic of China|China's record on human rights} and trade deals. There were several protesters outside {w|Downing Street}, who held a banner that read "Cameron and Wen: human rights before trade".The goal of the visit, part of a three-nation tour of Europe, is the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries. China is increasingly outsourcing its own manufacturing to less costly labour markets and wants to increase its investments in established European brands. Today, China and Britain announced contracts worth over one billion pounds.Hunt stressed that Wen's visit is not only about jobs. It is also about developing broader cultural ties "which is the best possible way to make sure we understand each other and  avoid the kind of misunderstanding that so can bedevil relationships, as has happened in the past," he told the BBC.The Chinese are interested in British happenings. About 30 million Chinese watched {w|Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|the recent Royal wedding}.== Sources == 
[[Scientists discover 300 new species on island of Luzon in the Philippines]]Scientists have identified more than 300 previously unknown species of land and sea creatures, according to a news release from the  {w|California Academy of Sciences}. They were discovered on a six-week-long expedition that ended in early June, and focused on the Philippine island of Luzon. The California Academy of Sciences, together with over two dozen Philippine colleagues, conducted the expedition that recorded the new terrestrial and marine life forms. Academy scientists who work in exotic places frequently discover new species, commonly only a few at one time. Finding 300 species that may be unknown on a single expedition is considered to be extraordinary, according to SF Gate.The findings will be confirmed using microscopes and {w|DNA sequencing}. The identification, scientific description and classification of each specimen as new or old, could take many months or even years.The expedition leader, Terry Gosliner, an {w|Invertebrate zoology|invertebrate zoologist} who is also  Dean of Science at the California academy, said, "The Philippines is one of the hottest of the {w|Biodiversity hotspot|hot spots} for diverse and threatened life on Earth. Despite this designation, however, the biodiversity here is still relatively unknown, and we found new species during nearly every dive and hike as we surveyed the country's {w|reef}s, {w|rainforest}s, and the {w|ocean floor}. The species lists and distribution maps that we created during this expedition will help to inform future conservation decisions and ensure that this remarkable {w|biodiversity} is afforded the best possible chance of survival." He emphasized the need for scientists to gather in-depth information about the rare life forms there so they can be given a chance to survive.On the 42-day expedition, academy officials said in the news release that the creatures found include "dozens of new insects and spiders, deep-sea armored {w|corals}, ornate {w|sea pen}s, bizarre new {w|sea urchin}s and {w|sea star}s, a shrimp-eating {w|Swellshark|swell shark}, and over 50 colorful new {w|sea slug}s."== Sources == 
[[Chinese political dissident Hu Jia freed as Chinese Premier Wen visits Britain]]The Chinese government released human rights activist {w|Hu Jia|Hu Jia} from prison on Sunday after he had served over three years for subversion. His release, which had been scheduled in advance, occurred just days after controversial artist {w|Ai Weiwei} was unexpectedly released on bail after three months of detention. Hu was released on the same day that Chinese Premier {w|Wen Jiabao}  began his visit to Britain, the first country  on his three-nation Europe trade tour.Described by the {w|Irish Times} as a "mild-mannered, slight figure who suffers from liver ailments", the 37-year-old Hu is  a prominent Chinese dissident who had  spent years campaigning for {w|Chinese democracy movement|civil liberties}, {w|environmentalism}, and on behalf of suffers of {w|HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China|HIV/AIDS} before his imprisonment. He was imprisoned in April 2008 for "inciting to subvert state power" by writing articles about human rights in the period before the {w|2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympic Games}. He had also given many interviews to foreign news media and government embassies. He was first  detained in December 2007 and his arrest came after he had spent more than 200 days under {w|house arrest}. In 2008 while in prison, he won the {w|Sakharov Prize} for freedom of thought,  awarded by the {w|European Parliament}. Hu's wife Zeng Jinyuan  said via Twitter that her husband lost his political rights upon his release and cannot speak to the media for a period of one year.  Hu was briefly interviewed on Sunday via telephone by {w|Cable TV Hong Kong|Hong Kong's Cable TV}, and indicated that despite the danger, he would not give up his work. " have told me to just be a normal citizen and don't confront the system because this system is very cruel, using the country's absolute power to violate people's dignity without restraint. But I can only tell my parents I will be careful", he said.Although  recent releases of high-profile dissidents such as Hu and Ai may seem to some that China is loosening its repressive policies against dissidents, activists and academics said yesterday that the determination of the Chinese government to silence dissent has not lessened and those speaking up continue to be rounded up and detained. Huang Qi, a dissident released this month from prison and  interviewed by telephone, said, "We closely follow dozens of rights' defense cases, and I've found that that at the {w|grassroots} and lowest levels of society in China, the rights defense environment has not seen any fundamental improvements." He warned, "One cannot count how many ordinary people are being locked up or taken away every day."However, Wan Yanhau who is a  Chinese activist living in the US said  there might be a short term diminishing of the crackdowns on human rights activists. He suggested  the government could be realizing that the harsh treatment of dissidents has not stopped recent episodes of unrest. The riots by migrant workers in the  {w|Guangdong} province and protests by ethnic {w|Mongolians} are recent examples. Further, China is receiving harsh criticism from European countries with which it wants to increase trade.But illegal detentions are increasing, according to  Nicholas Bequelin of {w|Human Rights Watch}, and are signs that China is not moving toward compliance with international norms.

Included was {w|AT&T} and AOL internal data, {w|Battlefield Heros} Beta user account data, and user information from the NATO bookstore. In total over 810,000 people's user information was present in this final release.LulzSec became known after they allegedly hacked the {w|Play Station Network}, rendering the service unusable. The group allegedly proceeded to hack US federal government websites such as those of the FBI and CIA. One of their last hacks targeted the Arizona {w|Arizona Department of Public Safety|Department of Public Safety} in which they allegedly copied hundreds of confidential documents.While LulzSec has disbanded, there are copycat organizations in Italy and Brazil.
[[Funeral held for former Zambian President Frederick Chiluba]]Chiluba led protests that caused then-President {W|Kenneth Kaunda} to agree to an election, which Chiluba won in 1991. During his two terms in office he allowed foreigners to invest in the nation. He relinquished his post in 2001 after attempts to modify the constitution to allow a third term saw his turn to face protests. Chiluba was a figure of some controversy, being implicated in various corruption allegations. Charged locally in 2002, a six-year trial produced an acquittal but a separate trial in London saw a fraud conviction in 2007. The British court ordered a repayment of {W|Pound sterling|?}36 million, but the Zambians never enforced the ruling. Chiluba also faced accusations of heavy-handed approaches to his opposition; outspoken journalists were imprisoned, and politicians were dismissed for critical remarks.Public opinion has remained sympathetic to the former ruler, whose funeral was attended by hundreds. It was projected on large screens and broadcast on state TV. Current President {W|Rupiah Banda}, President of the Democratic Republic of Congo {W|Joseph Kabila}, Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, and numerous provincial chiefs were among those present. Mozambique's President, {W|Armando Guebuza}, sent condolences; both Mozambican Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation Eduardo Bacio Koloma and Ambassador to Zambia Maria Leocadia attended the funeral at Belvedere Lodge. Chiluba's widow Regina and ex-wife Vera Tembo both attended.Chiluba was buried beside his successor {W|Levy Mwanawasa}, who died in 2008. Only former Presidents are buried at the cemetery. Chiluba's final years were spent at home on the grounds of ill-health; he was already unable to leave the country owing to the confiscation of his passport.Koloma said the leader would be remembered beyond Zambia for his championing of democracy. Mwaba Mushota, a friend of Chiluba, praised the man's representation of workers. No cause of death has been released for Chiluba, who died at his Lusaka home more than a week ago.== Sources == 
[[Greek workers strike over austerity measures]]Workers in Greece have gone on strike in protest against the government's second round of austerity packages. Greek prime minister {w|George Papandreou} announced ?28 billion in cuts Monday; loans worth up to ?155 billion from the European Union and International Monetary Fund depend on the measures passing.Tens of thousands of workers are planning to march through Athens and five thousand police officers have been brought into the capital to supervise the strike. Most public services in Greece are affected, including hospitals, ambulances, trains, buses, ferries and even air traffic control. The Athens metro will remain open "so as to allow Athenians to join the planned protests in the capital." Thanassis Pafilis, an MP with the Greek Communist Party, said that the budgetary measures "are a massacre for workers' rights," adding, "It will truly be hell for the working man. The strike must bring everything to a standstill."With a sixteen percent unemployment rate in Greece, between 70 and 80 percent of Greek citizens oppose the cuts. The measures are "tough and in many respects unfair," said Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos, but the government continues to push for austerity measures, as failure to secure credit may force the government and banks of Greece to default as early as July on the ?380 billion in debt owed to France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, Switzerland, Japan and Spain.

[[Philippine Foreign Secretary Del Rosario to visit China amid South China Sea territorial dispute]]Philippines Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario is scheduled to visit China from July 7 to 9, raising hopes that a territorial dispute between the two countries may be resolved. A six-nation dispute has escalated in the sea concerning {w|territorial waters|territorial claims} to several islands including the {w|Spratly Islands}. The area is thought to be rich in natural gas and oil. Both the Philippines and China wish to have a peaceful resolution to this conflict. "I¡¯ve been invited to Beijing and we¡¯re looking for peaceful means to settle the challenges facing us," said Del Rosario. The news comes after the United States and the Philippines began a series of naval exercises last week in the {w|South China Sea}, scheduled to last for 11 days. A Philippine military commander stated that the drills are part of an annual series of activities taking place under a defense agreement between the two countries and have nothing to do with the territorial dispute. The Philippines maintains a close relation with the U.S. as a former territory of the nation.The drills come at a time when several competing disputes in the South China Sea have begun to intensify. "Since February 25th, we actually have noted as many as nine intrusions of different varieties, but clearly becoming more aggressive and more frequent," said Del Rosario. Several countries in Asia, including China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and Taiwan, have territorial claims in the area spanning the Spratly and {w|Paracel Islands}. The region may be rich in oil and gas reserves. The US and Philippines have urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to address the conflict. On June 27, the US Senate unanimously passed a motion condemning "the use of force by naval and maritime security vessels from China in the South China Sea." China, on the other hand, has stated that it will not use force to resolve disputes in the South China Sea.== Sources == 
[[US Supreme Court rules video games are protected speech]]In a 7-2 decision handed down on Monday, the US Supreme Court struck down California's violent video game law and ruled that {w|video games} are protected speech covered by the {w|First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment}. The California law banned the sale and rental of violent video games to {w|Minor|minors}.The underlying question was whether the violence in video games has the ability to affect children more than violence in other media, such as books, movies, plays and other forms of entertainment.Justice {w|Antonin Scalia}, writing for the majority, said that depictions of violence have never been regulated by the US government.  Thus violent videos are not  to fall under government control as does {w|pornography} but is to be accorded the same First Amendment protections as other forms of entertainment. The sale of violent video games is not to be criminalized and California's attempt to do so was "unprecedented and mistaken." Scalia noted, referring to {w|fairy tales}, that "the books we give children to read¡ªor read to them when they are younger¡ªcontain no shortage of gore."  The beginning of the decision states,  "Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar {w|Literary technique|literary devices} and features distinctive to the medium. And 'the basic principles of {w|freedom of speech}...do not vary' with a new and different communication medium.""The most basic principle¡ªthat government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, {w|Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union}, 535 U. S. 564, 573¡ªis subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as {w|obscenity}, {w|incitement}, and {w|fighting words}. But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test."The justices were not convinced by the existing research that the {w|Interactive media|interactive nature of  video games} pose a greater risk to society because of their interactive nature. None of the results of the existing research put before the court showed that violent games cause violent behavior. "Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly under-inclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint."According to Nadine Kaslow, professor and chief psychologist at {w|Emory University|Emory University Department of Psychology} and {w|Grady Hospital}, the   evidence regarding the {w|Video game controversy|effects of  violent video games is mixed}. While there is evidence to suggest that exposure of children to violence results in  more aggressive and less pro-social behavior, some studies show there is no negative effect, she said. She point out that toy guns were popular and parents monitored whether toy guns were allowed in the home.This ruling does not prevent private retailers from placing restrictions  on their sale of  video games. The video game industry currently has its own {w|Entertainment Software Rating Board|rating system}, much like that used for movies, and  educates retailers in using the rating system to prevent minors from buying mature-rated games. According to {w|PC World|PC World} the industry's compliance is better than that of other entertainment industries.

[[Debris narrowly misses International Space Station]]Approximately half an hour after the closest approach of the debris, the crew were given the all-clear to reenter the space station from their escape capsules.Under normal circumstances and had mission controllers known about the collision threat sooner, the crew would have used the station's thrusters to maneuver out of the path of the oncoming debris.The size of the debris that threatened the station and its crew in this instance was not immediately known; however, even small fragments can become a major concern due to their high speed.Had the debris struck the ISS, the crew would have sealed their Soyuz spacecraft and departed the station. There are six people aboard the ISS and two Soyuz spacecrafts docked to the station. Each Soyuz contains accommodations for three people.This is not the first time that debris threatened the ISS and its crew. A similar incident occurred in March 2009. Estimations show that there are more than 300,000 pieces of debris in {w|Low-earth orbit|Low-Earth orbit} over {Cm to in|10} in length, which travel several thousands of kilometers per hour.== Sources ==

[[Report finds teen substance abuse is top public health problem in US]]A report issued Wednesday by the {w|Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse} at {w|Columbia University} finds  the top {w|public health} problem in the United States is teen {w|drug abuse}, including  the use of  {w|Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|alcohol}, {w|tobacco}, {w|prescription drug abuse|prescription drugs}, {w|marijuana} and other {w|controlled substance|controlled substances}. According to the study's authors, "The study looks at how American culture increases the risk that teens will use addictive substances and how the messages sent by adults, and glamorized by the tobacco and alcohol industries and the media, normalize substance use and undermine the health and futures of our teens." CASA  found that 90% of adults who have {w|Addiction|addictive disorders} started using substances before the age of 18. In comparison, only 4% of  Americans who abuse as adults started using these drugs when 21 or older. Further, the consumption of these substances by American teens is rising. Currently almost half of American high school students smoke, drink alcohol or use other drugs, according to the study, and 1 in 5  meet the {w|Physical dependence|medical criteria for addiction}. Seventy-five percent of all high school students have used addictive substances including tobacco, alcohol, marijuana or cocaine at some point. Over 65% have used more than one.   The researchers found  social factors  related to the risk of American teens use of addictive substances included parental, community and school  acceptance of these substances and the positive media portrayals of drug use as harmless, fun and attractive.  Advertising of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes also contributes to the positive image of drug use.The researchers used online surveys filled out by 1,000 high school students, 1,000 parents of high school students, 500 educators, as well as information from  five focus groups and reviews of 2,000 scientific articles and reports, according to {w|US News}. "Addiction is a disease that in most cases begins in adolescence, so preventing or delaying teens from using alcohol, tobacco or other drugs for as long as possible is crucial to their health and safety," said Susan Foster, CASA's vice president in a news release. "We rightfully worry about other teen health problems like {w|obesity}, {w|Depression|depression} or {w|bullying}, but we turn a blind eye to a more common and deadly epidemic that we can in fact prevent."The study's authors  pointed out that the teenage  brain is not fully developed and the use of drugs during the teenage years hampers further development of the  brain, impairs judgment and increases the risk of addiction as an adult. Heavy substance abuse harms the developing brain far more than the already developed adult  brain. They  concluded their data shows that {w|adolescence} is the critical age  period for the onset of substance abuse and its repercussions. == Sources == 
[[Hundreds of thousands of British public sector workers strike over planned pension changes]]Hundreds of thousands of British public sector workers went on strike across the country yesterday to protest planned changes to {w|pensions}. As {w|industrial action} swept the country, half of all schools were hit when teachers walked out, thousands of emergency service responders did not arrive at work, and there were warnings of immigration delays at {w|Heathrow airport}.Police arrested 26 people as protesters picketed on a march in London, and riot police {w|kettling|kettled} demonstrators as clashes broke out. Reports vary, but it is thought that up to half of British {w|state schools} have been affected as employees did not turn up to work. Government officials condemned the strike and said the planned changes to pensions, which would see teachers work until age 68 and get less from their pensions, were "fair to taxpayers" as Britain attempts to deal with a large {w|budget deficit}. A spokesperson for {w|Downing Street} insisted the strike was having a "minimal" impact and said the turnout suggested many public sector workers supported the pension changes. But despite government claims that the strike was having little impact, 5,679 schools were closed and another 4,999 were affected as teachers did not turn up for work. {w|Michael Gove}, the {w|education secretary|education secretary} attacked the walkouts as "disappointing and unnecessary". Thousands of staff handling emergency {w|999 calls} also striked and pickets were held outside courts as members of the PCS walked out in protest.Senior Labour party figures including {w|Ed Miliband}, {w|Tessa Jowell} and {w|John Denham} said the strikes were unjustified until negotiations with the government had concluded. Mary Bousted of the NUT criticised Labour's lack of support for the striking workers: "The response of Ed Miliband has been a disgrace - he should be ashamed of himself. If our strike is a mistake, what has he done to oppose this devastating attack on our pensions? If the opposition will not defend our pensions, we will."A largely peaceful march by 30,000 protesters took place through London, and the atmosphere was reported to be largely peaceful, but {w|Metropolitan Police} officials said 26 people had been arrested. At a meeting in {w|Westminister}, many left wing figures attacked the government plans. {w|Ken Livingstone}, a former mayor of London who is running for the job again next year, said the coalition government had "mishandled" the issue of pensions. "The government must end its attacks and negotiate on the core issues under contention," he added.== Sources == 
[[U.S. space agency NASA sues ex-astronaut]]NASA, the space agency of the United States, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against former astronaut and sixth human to walk on the Moon {w|Edgar Mitchell}. NASA filed the lawsuit in a Miami federal court after learning of Mitchell's plans to auction off a camera that was used on the surface of the Moon during the {w|Apollo 14} mission.Mitchell, 80, claims that he had permission from NASA to keep the camera, saying that astronauts of his era were permitted to keep mementos from their missions. He argues that had he not kept the camera, it would have been destroyed: "It was government throwaways, government junk."According to the lawsuit, however, NASA claims that "All equipment and property used during NASA operations remains the property of NASA unless explicitly released or transferred to another party." NASA goes on to claim that there is no official record of the possession of the camera being transferred to Mitchell.The camera, which Mitchell planned to sell because of financial problems, was expected to catch about US$60,000 to $80,000.Mitchell, along with Commander {w|Alan Shepard} and Command Module Pilot {w|Stuart Roosa}, flew to the moon aboard the Apollo 14 mission in 1971, the third manned lunar landing. While Roosa orbited above, Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours on the surface of the Moon. Shepard and Mitchell became the fifth and sixth humans to walk on the Moon, respectively.== Sources ==

McCotter has outlined five "core" principles for his campaign: Although McCotter previously stated that "if I run, I would be in to win", he received only two votes in a {w|Republican Leadership Conference} {w|Straw polls for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|straw poll} two weeks ago, and lacks the name recognition of his fellow challengers for the nomination. {w|Charlie Cook} of the {w|The Cook Political Report} rated it "virtually impossible" for McCotter to be nominated.Other candidates for the Republican nomination include fellow Representatives {w|Michele Bachmann} of Minnesota and Ron Paul of Texas as well as former Massachusetts {w|Governor of Massachusetts|Governor} Mitt Romney,  former Utah {w|Governor of Utah|Governor} {w|Jon Huntsman, Jr.}, former {w|Speaker of the House of Representatives|Speaker of the House} {w|Newt Gingrich}, and businessman {w|Herman Cain}.An adviser said McCotter is dissatisfied with the current candidates and "has something to say and has some ideas and some policies to put out there that nobody else is discussing right now...his presence in the race is going to force these issues and force this discussion that the country has to have right now."According to {w|The Detroit News}, next month, as he campaigns for the presidency, McCotter plans to propose a {w|Social Security debate|social security reform} bill.== Sources == 
[[US Virgin Islands]]The Arbitration Committee is a community-elected group of users who may hold hearings in serious disputes that cannot otherwise be resolved by the community. In general, ArbCom hearings are intended to be about whether core policies like NPOV and Wikiquette are followed. The members of ArbCom can decide whether or not they want to hear a particular case brought before them through Wikinews:Requests for arbitration. Be aware that arbitration duty can still be rather time-intensive in complex cases, and that you will be required to recuse yourself from cases you are involved in. The community must agree on nomination procedures by July 1, and election committee members by July 10. Nominations will be accepted until July 17. Questions and comments may be made during that time period, but no voting shall take place. Voting will take place from 2000 UTC July 18 to 2000 UTC July 30. Since the incumbent members' seats expire on August 3, the election committee must declare the winners by that date, and the new term begins on August 4.
[[US children who celebrate Independence Day more likely to become Republicans, says Harvard study]]A study conducted by {w|Harvard University} researchers has concluded that children who attend an {w|Independence Day|Independence Day} celebration are more likely to become {w|Republican Party|Republicans} as adults. Even attending a single fireworks display or flag-waving parade, specifically celebrations without rain, can be predictive of a child's future political leanings and voting habits. "One Fourth of July without rain before age 18 increases the likelihood of identifying as a Republican at age 40 by 2 percent, the share of people voting for the Republican candidate at age 40 by 4 percent, and the share of people turning out to vote at age 40 by 0.9 percent," the researchers claim. Moreover, the data does not suggest that the {w|Democratic Party|Democratic} base is affected at all by the holiday celebrations. "There is no evidence of an increased likelihood of identifying as a Democrat, indicating that Fourth of July shifts preferences to the right rather than increasing political polarization," the study claims.David Yanagizawa-Drott, a public policy professor at Harvard and a co-author of the study, suggests that "the celebration of Fourth of July embodies certain ideas or values that are closer to the Republican Party," but adds that further study is needed to explain this trend. Another explanation offered by the study is that celebrations in Republican-dominated areas may tend to be more politically charged. == Sources == 
[[United States presidential election, 2012]]One complication here is that political dynamics are a moving target.  If someone is at least 40 years old, and attended a Fourth of July event without rain before they were 18, that means they attended the event either while, or before, Ronald Reagan was president.  One wonders how this correlation might vary depending on what year the person attended the event, or what year the person turned forty.It'd also be fascinating to know how the probability of good weather on July 4 varies with geographical region of the country.
[[Over half of Romanian terminal grade students fail baccalaureate exam]]Only 44.47 percent of Romanian high school students passed last week's 2011 {w|Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate exam},  according to the results published by Romanian  education authorities on Sunday. The baccalaureate exam in Romania is the secondary school educational qualification test, and passing it attests that a student has graduated high school and may be admitted to a university.  This is dramatically different from 69.3 percent last year and 81.4 percent in 2009. Sunday's passing figures are a record low since the exam was introduced in Romania and comes after new anti-fraud measures cut back on student cheating. These included installing cameras in examination centres and forbidding students from paying teachers to obtain higher scores. For this exam, 665 high school students were caught cheating, double the number from last year, and at one high school it was found that the exam answers were given to 111 pupils prior to the exam. The release of the results started a national debate on the possible causes of the drastic drop in scores, from the failure of parental participation, poor teacher pay and pay cuts,  to student disinterest and lack of motivation. Critics say the educational system depends on rote learning and students are not taught to think independently. Students say the school curriculum is boring and out-of-date. At a press conference on Monday,  Education minister Daniel Funeriu said, "These results are a mirror of our society. Romania is now at a crossroads...The nation should choose to encourage people who like to work rather than those who prefer cheating".Cristian Alexandrescu, chief education inspector for Bucharest, argued that the exam was not taken seriously by students and the results  prove that a student cannot obtain a diploma without effort. "The moment of truth has come," Liliana Romanciuc, a school inspector in north-eastern Romania, told {w|Mediafax}. "Success rates topping 80 percent were not possible. We were simply deluding ourselves."== Sources ==

He officially became President in December. During his time in office he faced a financial crisis with hyper-inflation.

[[Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple]]Officials announced that a treasure containing sacks of diamonds and gold coins as well as golden idols, jewelry and other riches has been discovered in the secret subterranean vaults of {w|Padmanabhaswamy Temple|Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple}, in the southwestern state of Kerala, India. Estimates of its worth have been rising and it is now thought to be worth $20 billion.The Hindu temple was built in the 16th century by the kings of the then  {w|Kingdom  of Travancore} to serve as a royal chapel for the {w|Travancore Royal Family|rulers of Travancore}. The six vaults containing the treasure have been undisturbed for over a century. Assessment of the treasure began on June 27 after a lawyer concerned about the security of the treasure petitioned India's Supreme Court, which then appointed a seven-member panel of experts to inventory the treasure. The panel does not have the power to determine to whom the treasure will belong. Estimates of the treasure's worth are rising, provoking a heated  debate as to how the treasure will be used in a country that has 450 million poverty-stricken people. The {w|chief minister of Kerala}, {w|Oommen Chandy}, announced on Sunday the treasure would remain with the temple, and security matters would be decided in consultation with the {w|Travancore Royal Family}, the temple management, and  the temple priest. "The gold was offered to the lord. It is the property of the temple. The government will protect the wealth at the temple," Oommen Chandy said. Meanwhile, hundreds of armed police have been deployed around the temple to protect the treasure.However, the view that the treasure should remain at the temple has been disputed. Among the dissenters is eminent jurist {w|V. R. Krishna Iyer|V R Krishna Iyer}, who said the treasure should be put in a national trust for the peoples' benefit. "God¡¯s wealth belongs to the people, not to the king. It¡¯s meaningless to say that it belongs to {w|Hindus} or any particular religious community," said Iyer. "A mechanism should be devised to ensure that the benefits of it reach the poor and the needy and not the rich."Five of the six vaults of the  Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple have been inventoried. On Saturday, reports leaked to the press revealed that the treasure, including a golden idol of {w|Mahavishnu} and a golden 'anki', were found in one of the vaults, estimated to weigh 30 kilograms,  along with precious stones, silver, two coconut shells of pure gold and another golden idol as well as other jewels and valuable coins. The panel hopes to find more treasure when the sixth and final vault is opened, but the attempt was suspended on Monday because the iron door inside presented "technical problems" requiring further consultation before opening. This vault is  thought to contain the bulk of the wealth. Keralan officials in a preliminary estimate said that the treasure was worth over $11.2 billion; those estimates have now risen to $20 billion. Historians say that the temple's location  on a site through which passed lucrative {w|trade routes} support the higher evaluations. "Traders, who used to come from other parts of the country and abroad for buying spices and other commodities, used to make handsome offerings to the deity for not only his blessings but also to please the then rulers," said P.J. Cherian, the director of Kerala Council for Historic ResearchSome suggest that the profit from the sale of the treasure would be enough to wipe out the entire public debt of Kerala and fund future Kerala  projects such as  seaports, airports and highways.== Sources == 
[[More than half of the Romanian high-school students fail the baccalaureate exam as the results are revealed]]Why?  Why is this a subject of study?  I am left to make the logical assumption that the reason for this analysis is to somehow show that attending July 4th activities as a child is somehow unfair to democrats???  This pushes me to make the next assumption that voting republican is somehow a bad thing in the eyes of the authors.  Bottom line, it is sad to see Harvard, considered to be one of our brightest institutions, with professors creating such crap!  Especially right now when it is obvious Keynesian economic policy has failed the US.  Out of all the things people could analyze we have professors from Harvard analyzing rainfall on the 4th of July to determine if they vote Republican...  How pathetic!  Just to put more salt on this wound before I stop writing... I can't wait to see what increased taxes, inflation, another stimulus package and increased healthcare costs do for this country.  All while our federal government allows the deficit to spiral out of control!!!  Then you add on some illegal immigration, entitlements offered to everyone who wants to sit on their butt all day and 3 wars that we shouldn't be in...  Is this the CHANGE you were looking for?

According to the Post, former San Francisco {w|Mayor of San Francisco|Mayor} {w|Willie Brown|Willie Brown} made the claim earlier in the year.

The most recent prediction came from former New York GOP chairman {w|William Powers|William Powers}, who reportedly told the Post "I don't think there's any doubt Obama is going to pick him as his running mate.

[[US Senate postpones vote on Libya conflict to focus on national debt]]The US Senate has postponed voting on a resolution to authorize limited US military operations in Libya, after {w|Republican Party|Republican politicians} said they wanted to focus on {w|United States public debt|the national debt}. The resolution would have authorized a supporting role in the {w|2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya conflict} for up to a year. It specifically prohibited the deployment of US ground forces, and the use of US resources in reconstruction efforts. The administration of President Barack Obama has argued that congressional authorization is not needed, but welcomes a statement of support from the legislature. Last month, several US congressmen filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration, claiming its military operations in Libya are illegal because they did not have legislative approval.A procedural vote to authorize military operations in Libya was scheduled for yesterday evening. Two Republicans raised their objections on the floor that afternoon, saying that if they had to skip their holiday recess, then they wanted to work on the debt crisis. {w|Bob Corker} of Tennessee claimed the House of Representatives previously rejecting a resolution to authorize US involvement in the Libya conflict meant Senate action was "totally irrelevant". Democrats currently hold a majority in the 100-member Senate, but not the 60 votes needed to proceed to final votes. Reid agreed that "the most important thing for us to focus on this week is the budget". Instead of the Libya resolution, the Senate will consider a non-binding resolution that urges the rich to "make a more meaningful contribution to the deficit reduction effort".== Sources == 
[[Officers accused of framing men for murder in UK's 'biggest' trial of police]]The trial of eight retired police officers and two witnesses involved in a high-profile Welsh miscarriage of justice began yesterday in {w|Swansea}, south Wales.  The ten are accused of framing three men for murder. The {W|Independent Police Complaints Commission} thinks it is the largest trial of police the UK has ever seen.20-year-old prostitute Lynette White was murdered in her {W|Cardiff} flat in 1988. Two years later, the 'Cardiff Three' ¡ª Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris ¡ª were convicted of her murder. They were cleared on appeal in 1992. Cousins Ronnie and John Actie were tried alongside the Three, but cleared. In 2003 the real killer, Jeffrey Gafoor, admitted to the crime and was sentenced to life in prison. Gafoor, a client of White's, stabbed her more than 50 times. All those presently accused deny the allegations against them. The eight policemen are accused of a joint conspiracy to {W|pervert the course of justice} in a plot to "mould, manipulate, influence and fabricate evidence."Amongst these are three senior officers ¡ª {W|chief superintendent} Thomas Page, {W|chief inspector} Graham Mouncher and chief inspector Richard Powell. Mouncher also faces two charges of {W|perjury} ¡ª the offence of lying under oath in court. The junior officers accused in the conspiracy are Michael Daniels, Paul Jennings, Paul Stephen, Peter Greenwood, and John Seaford.Alongside Mouncher, original trial witnesses Violet Perriam and Ian Massey also face two counts of perjury each. Both were civilians working for the police. Perriam is said to have lied by saying she saw people including Actie at the crime scene; Massey's charges relate to his claiming Paris had confessed.The ten defendants are being tried before Mr Justice Sweeney, who will also oversee a second trial next year in which four more police officers face related charges. The cases were not tried together because of practicalities.A jury was sworn in at Swansea {w|Crown Court} yesterday, drawn from a panel of 400 potential jurors. The judge warned them to take no heed of contemporary or historic reporting on any of the trials, and refrain from talking to anyone about the case. Nick Dean QC, for the prosecution, told them they were dealing with a complicated, unusual case. The trial could take up to six months to complete.== Sources ==

[[Finnish Olympic champion skier Mika Myllyl? found dead]]Finnish cross-country skier {W|Mika Myllyl?}, a six-time {W|Olympic} medalist, including one gold, has been found dead. He was 41. Police said he was alone at his apartment in {W|Kokkola} and no crime is suspected. His cause of death remains unclear. Born 1969 in {W|Oulu}, Myllyl? won Olympic silver at the 50km cross-country race in {W|1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer, Norway in 1994}, and gold at the 30km cross-country race in {W|1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano, Japan in 1998}. These two Games netted him four bronze medals. The {W|FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1999|1999 World Championship} in Austria saw him win three gold medals and one silver. This and other World Championships saw him gain a total of nine World Championship medals.It was at the {W|FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2001|2001 World Championships} in his native Finland that things went wrong for Myllyl?. A {W|Finnish Ski Association} bag was accidentally left at a petrol station close to {W|Helsinki}'s {W|Helsinki Airport|International Airport}; it was handed in to police, who discovered needles, {W|infusion bag}s and a prescription for banned drug {W|Hemohes} signed off by a team doctor.HES had been banned the previous year by the {W|International Olympic Committee} because it reduced {W|hemoglobin} concentration and oxygen-carrying red blood cell counts; this allowed it to mask the presence of banned drug {W|erythropoietin}, which raises red blood cell production. Last year Myllyl? provided a court with a sworn statement confirming he had used EPO in the decade preceding the controversy.Myllyl? and five other Finnish skiers tested positive for HES in what became a national scandal; the Finnish Ski Association's president, and the team's doctors and coaches left or were sacked. Myllyl? was handed a two-year sporting ban, after which he returned to competitive skiing; although he twice won the national championships, he gave up in 2005.These events changed Myllyl?, according to longtime friend and national cross-country skiing association chair Reijo Alakoski. "He should be remembered as a great athlete... Mika changed completely as a person on the day his doping was made public. It has been sad to watch his descent and anguish from the sidelines over the last ten years." His passing "is a dark day in the history of Ostrobothnian cross-country skiing," said Alakoski.Since then his personal life has been difficult. Drink-driving convictions came in 2008 and 2010 as Myllyl? fought alcoholism, and he was thrice convicted of assault. He and his wife Suvi were divorced in 2007."A champion has passed into eternity," according to ex-Finnish Ski Association CEO Jari Piirainen. "Although Mika will of course be remembered for his sporting achievements, we should of course remember that he was also a father." Piirainen also reflected on media attention towards Myllyl?: "Maybe it's just... how much pressure we put on our idols and sportsmen. And how do we deal with them when they are at the top ¨C do we accept that people are people and accept that everyone makes mistakes, and forgive them?"Piirainen himself was caught up in the doping scandal after a news story into Finnish doping led to a libel case. Piirainen's statements in court led to him facing a fraud trial, but he was cleared."My heart is broken," Myllyl? said when his doping was exposed "and there is no way to describe the amount of my agony with words. I kneel down, admit my defeat and beg for peace for my soul." The then-culture minister, {W|Suvi Linden}, said at the time "Everyone who felt joy at the success of the team now feels betrayed."Myllyl? fathered three children, whom he is survived by.== Sources == 
[[Bahamas become fourth country to ban shark fishing]]The Bahamas on Tuesday approved a law banning shark fishing in its waters, along with selling, importing and exporting shark products. This makes the Bahamas the fourth country to ban shark fishing, joining the Maldives, Honduras, and Palau. The 630,000 sq km of water around the Bahamas has now become an official {w|shark sanctuary}.The ban is welcomed by many, including environmentalists. The President of the {w|Bahamas National Trust}, Neil McKinney, spoke about the issue saying, "They desperately need protection if we're not going to drive them to extinction." Deputy Prime Minister {w|Brent Symonette} also commented on the ban: "This is in keeping with the government's commitment to pursue conservation policies and strategies in order to safeguard the marine and terrestrial environment."However, some feel that the ban will affect relations with China. {w|Shark-fin soup} is highly popular in China, with around 73 million sharks killed every year. To prepare shark-fin soup, the {w|Shark finning|fins are often scraped off}, and the body of the shark is thrown back into the water.  A report published by the {w|Pew Charitable Trusts} found that shark populations have fallen by 70 to 80 per cent, with a third of all shark species being threatened or nearly threatened by {w|extinction}.== Sources == 
[[Cassini spacecraft captures large storm on Saturn]]On Wednesday NASA released details of a giant {w|Thunderstorm|convective storm} on {w|Saturn} gathered from the international {w|Cassini¨CHuygens|Cassini spacecraft} orbiting the planet. The storm, known as a "{w|Great White Spot}", is around 6,200 miles wide and visible from {w|Earth}. The White Spot storms have been observed since 1876 and occur approximately every 30 years; only five previous storms have been seen in the last 137 years. The first signs were detected on December 5, 2010 by instruments aboard the Cassini spacecraft when it recorded lightening outbursts in a small bright area on Saturn's northern half. The area was tracked by the spacecraft and by astronomers on the ground through telescopes. It was later identified as a brewing storm during the start of Saturn spring. Its size and intensity grew until its tail wrapped around the planet. It now covers 1.5 billion square miles.Cassini has been monitoring storms on Saturn since the craft arrived there in 2004. This is the most intense yet seen and was observed in unprecedented detail, according to  the journal {w|Nature|Nature} in two papers published Thursday. The storm  is 500 times larger than the biggest storm on Saturn monitored by Cassini. The spacecraft's  instruments  showed the rate of the nearly continuous lightning flashes was up to ten times more frequent than during past storms it has monitored. This electrical activity is 10,000 times stronger than lightning bursts measured on Earth.Saturn's huge storm is bright due to its {w|gas|gaseous} content, scientists say.A key question is the source of the energy powering  Great White Spots. Originally researchers thought the storms' power might come from the sun. However,  researcher Agustin S¨¢nchez-Lavega told {w|Space.com} the new data showed that to make sense of the cloud patterns, the winds must "extend deep into the 'weather layer' ... where the main clouds reside." Since sunlight does not reach this depth, this "points to the action of an internal heat source as the power for the winds."

[[Murdoch axes News of the World after hacking allegations startle politicians]]British tabloid newspaper the {w|News of the World} has been axed after a week of devastating allegations about {w|News of the World phone hacking scandal|phone hacking} in the paper that has struck at the heart of {w|News International}, the media giant owned by {w|Rupert Murdoch}. The announcement that the paper will close came after advertisers backed out of the publication due to emerging allegations that journalists at the paper may have hacked into the {w|voicemail} messages of missing schoolgirl {w|Milly Dowler}, victims of the {w|7/7 terror attacks} and families of servicemen killed in Afghanistan. The last edition of News of the World will be printed Sunday."Having consulted senior colleagues, I have decided that we must take further decisive action with respect to the paper," News International chairman {w|James Murdoch} said in a statement after police announced they believed as many as 4,000 people may have had their phones hacked by NotW journalists. The closure of the Sunday tabloid¡ªthe best-selling newspaper in the country¡ªtopped a week of allegations that lead to devastating criticisms of Murdoch's media empire and forced Prime Minister David Cameron to order a public inquiry into the hacking.In a dramatic week for Murdoch, it was reported that journalists hacked into the phones of the families of British soldiers killed during the {w|war in Afghanistan}, and relatives of the victims of the July 7, 2005, attacks on London. Police have also contacted the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler to warn them that reporters working for the NotW may have hacked into her mobile phone after she disappeared in 2002, leading them to falsely believe that she was still alive.Alleged hacking victims and politicians from all sides have rounded on Murdoch this week and demanded {w|Rebekah Brooks}, the chief executive of News International, resign. Announcing a public inquiry into the hacking allegations, Cameron said on Wednesday that reports in {w|The Guardian} about the hacking of Dowler's phone were "absolutely disgusting." Speaking to the {w|House of Commons}, he said, "I think everyone in this house and indeed this country will be revolted by what they have heard and what they have seen on their television screens."== Sources == 
[[Polar bears related to extinct Irish bears, DNA study shows]]Modern {w|polar bear|polar bears} are genetically related to an extinct species of Irish brown bear, according to a study published Thursday in {w|Current Biology}.  The two share a distinct {w|genetic marker} not present in other brown bears, strongly suggesting that all modern polar bears are descended from the same extinct species.The study found evidence of polar bear {w|Hybrid|hybridization} with a now-extinct population of brown bears that lived in Ireland and Britain during the last ice age. {w|Brown bear|Brown bears} are no longer found on the British Isles, and it had been thought that polar bears interbred more recently with brown bears living around Alaska. However, the samples used in the analysis came from the past 120,000 years and show that {w|interbreed|interbreeding} of the two species occurred a great deal earlier. Climate change is thought to have presented opportunities for the two species to mate now and then in the past 100,000 years. The evidence comes from a {w|DNA} analysis of fossil bones collected from the teeth and bones of seventeen bears from eight Irish caves. Ten Irish brown bears from between 10,000 and 38,000 years ago carried a distinct sequence of {w|mitochondrial DNA}, originating from a specific female brown bear, and this {w|DNA sequence} has been passed down the female polar bear line and is found in all polar bears today. It is not found in modern bears from Europe.Fossils from the last species of ancient brown bears in Ireland, living from 3,000 to 5,000 years ago, have a different genetic fingerprint, matching neither that of polar bears nor of modern brown bears.A member of the international team conducting the study, Dr Ceiridwen Edwards from Oxford University, said: "Hybridisation between ancient Irish brown bears and polar bears has led to the complete replacement of the original polar bear {w|mitochondria}. This maternal lineage is now present in all modern polar bears."The authors of the paper conclude that their evidence shows that matrilineal history of brown and polar bears suggest that "a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear {w|Matrilineality|matriline}." They suggest that hybridization may be more common than previously recognized and may be a way species deal with loss of their  {w|Habitat|habitats} when the environment is changing.== Sources == 
[[British Gas to increase electricity, gas prices]]British-based utility company {w|Centrica}, which holds ownership of British Gas, has announced its intentions to increase the prices of domestic electricity and gas later this year. On August 18, 2011, the company plans to raise the costs of gas and electrical supplies by eighteen and sixteen per cent, respectively. According to {w|The Guardian}, nine million customers will be affected by these changes.British price comparison website uSwitch has reported that the "[a]verage household bill for a dual fuel British Gas customer will now go up from {w|Pound sterling|?}1,096 to ?1,288". Mike O'Connor, the {w|Chief executive officer|chief executive officer} of consumer organisation {w|Consumer Focus}, has claimed that the announcement "will send a shock wave across the country" and will place an increasing amount of difficulties "on stretched household budgets. Consumers [...] rightly question whether prices are fair."Phil Bentley, a managing director for British Gas, has claimed that value increases like this are "an issue facing all energy suppliers". A director for British Gas, named Ian Peters, has claimed that "a fair return" will be made after the changes occur.In 2010, British Gas experienced its largest ever profit, making ?742 million. Meanwhile, Centrica achieved ?2.4 billion in profits. Richard Lloyd from product sampling charity {w|Which?} criticised the decision to raise prices, calling the declaration "unwelcome but unsurprising" for British Gas consumers.Previously in December 2010, British Gas increased the price of its gas by 6.9%, which equates to ?43. At the same time, the company's electricity prices were raised by 6.7%, or ?28. On Friday, Chris Huhne, the secretary of the {w|Energy and Climate Change Select Committee}, said that British electricity businesses must modify themselves so as to avoid "the cycle of fossil fuel addiction. Alternatives like renewables and nuclear power must be allowed to become the dominant component of our energy mix," said Huhne.This news comes to light as {w|Scottish Power}, a rival energy company to British Gas, announced last month their intentions to up the prices of their electricity and gas supplies by ten and nineteen per cent respectively.== Sources == 
[[British Gas increase electricity, gas prices]]At 11:29 AM {w|Eastern time|EDT} today, the {w|Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle Atlantis} launched on the final mission in NASA's {w|Space Shuttle program}, {w|STS-135}.The mission is slated to last 12 days and will deliver parts and supplies to the International Space Station, including the {w|Raffaello MPLM|Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module} and an experiment, the Robotic Refueling Mission, designed to test methods, tools, and technologies required to robotically refuel satellites in space, even those not designed to be serviced.The launch occurred despite weather concerns at {w|Kennedy Space Center} in Florida, United States. Although there was a short two and a half minute hold in the countdown at T-31 seconds while engineers worked out a small glitch, the launch was flawless.Eight and a half minutes after lifting off for the final time, Atlantis reached its preliminary orbit, travelling over 17,000 miles per hour several hundreds of miles above the Earth.The crew of STS-135 consists of only four astronauts, the smallest shuttle crew since {w|STS-6} in 1983: Commander {w|Christopher Ferguson}, Pilot {w|Douglas Hurley}, and Mission Specialists {w|Sandra Magnus} and {w|Rex Walheim}. STS-135 is the third spaceflight for Ferguson, Magnus, and Walheim, and the second for Hurley.Futhermore, an {w|iPhone} will be the first one to ever be brought into space aboard the flight with an application developed for the Apple {w|smartphone}, called SpaceLab for iOS,  that is meant to help the astronauts track their scientific results and perhaps one day aid in navigation. The device will be housed inside a small research platform built by the company NanoRacks. The platform will be placed inside the ISS. Along with the iPhone, a flag from the first shuttle mission, STS-1, will be brought along on the flight and left aboard the orbital outpost until the first commercial spaceflight to the station, when NASA astronauts will retrieve it.An estimated 750,000 people crowded the launch site as Atlantis flexed "its muscles one final time", in the words of NASA ascent commentator Rob Navias.The first mission of the Space Shuttle program, {w|STS-1}, launched on April 12, 1981. Since then, 135 missions over 30 years have been launched. Out of these flights, two involved catastrophic failures, {w|STS-51-L} {w|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger} in January 1986 and {w|STS-107} {w|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia} in February 2003, both killing all on board. During the entire shuttle program, 355 people from 16 countries have flown 852 times aboard the Space Shuttle. The five {w|Space Shuttle orbiter|shuttle orbiters} have flown {mi to km|537114016}.During her career spanning over 26 years, Atlantis flew on 33 flights, including the first shuttle docking to the Russian {w|Mir} space station on {w|STS-71} in June 1995, the first launch with a camera mounted on the exterior of the {w|Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank} on {w|STS-112} in October 2002, and the final servicing mission to the {w|Hubble Space Telescope} on {w|STS-125} in May 2009.The final Space Shuttle launch marks the end of an era for NASA and the United States amid uncertainty about the American space program's and NASA's future.Before the launch, mission commander Christopher Ferguson made a statement conveying his thoughts about the program's end: "The shuttle is always going to be a reflection of what a great nation can do when it dares to be bold and commits to follow through. We're not ending the journey today ... we're completing a chapter of a journey that will never end."== Sources == 
[[June jobs report shows rising US unemployment, economic outlook worsens]]The June jobs report for the US shows job growth has almost halted while the {w|unemployment rate} rose from 9.1% to 9.2%, much higher than March's figure of 8.8%. Employers added only 18,000 new jobs, far fewer than the average of 215,000 per month added from February to April. These numbers  add to fears that the economic recovery has stalled. Analysts were predicting the job growth number for June to reach  125,000, according to a {w|CNN} poll.Additionally, the figures for May were revised downward from 54,000 to 25,000 for a two month downward trend. To keep up with normal population growth, the US economy needs to increase the available jobs by 150,000 monthly. Only one fifth of the 8.8 million jobs lost since 2008 when the recession began have been added.There was no encouraging news in the report.  Government jobs fell by 39,000, and construction jobs remained stalled. Manufacturing added an anemic 6,000 jobs.  The temporary-job industry lost positions for the third straight month. The average work week was reduced  by 0.1 hours to 34.3. And the average hourly salary for private sector workers fell by one cent.The total number of unemployed people remains around 14.1 million, and 6.3 million have been unemployed at least six months. "It's just an across-the-board retreat," said Heidi Shierholz, labor economist at the {w|Economic Policy Institute}. "This is two months of really scary reports."In an interview, Austan Goolsbee, Barack Obama's chief economist said, "I view this number as a call to action. This number illustrates this thing that we knew, which is we¡¯ve got to get the growth rate up. ... When you see jobs reports like this, that should make it clear that we need to stop bickering, and get these things done."== Sources ==

[[US government reports decline in teen birth rate and binge drinking, rise in poverty and drug abuse]]The US government has released a report with mixed news on the health of American children, ranging from a fall in the rates of teen births, premature births, deaths from injury, and binge drinking, to a rise in the rates of drug abuse, poverty, and obesity.  The report, named America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2011, was prepared by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, with participants from 22 federal government agencies and their private partners. This year's report ¡ª the group's fifteenth ¡ª presents 41 indicators on children's "family and social environment, economic circumstances, health care, physical environment and safety, behavior, education, and health". The teen birth rate dropped from 21.7 per 1,000 girls in 2008 to 20.1 per 1,000 girls in 2009. This trend has been going on for a while, with only a slight "blip" a few years ago, according to Edward Sondik, the director of the National Center for Health Statistics in the {w|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}. The CDC is unsure of the causes of this trend, but teen births are of particular concern to federal health officials due to the socioeconomic burden of pregnancy and childbearing.The rates of premature births, infant deaths, teen injuries, and binge drinking among 12th graders also fell during the same time period. Math scores for 8th and 12th graders rose by 2009. On the other hand, the report observes a rising rate of illegal drug usage, and of children living in poverty or inadequate housing. These characteristics may correlate with the marital status of the children's parents: 41 percent of babies are born to unmarried mothers. The percentage of children with asthma remained at about 9.6 percent from 2008 to 2009, but steadily rose from 8.8 percent in 2001. The report also features a new section on adoption, which is generally preferred over long-term foster care or other alternatives. About 2.5 percent of US children are adopted, and 21.5 percent are of a different race than their guardians. == Sources == 
[[South Sudan gains independence]]At 0000 {w|East Africa Time|EAT} Saturday, the Republic of South Sudan achieved independent recognition, becoming the newest country on the planet. The parliament speaker for the new country recited a formal independence declaration. After independence was declared, the South Sudanese flag was lifted for all to see, with {w|Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement} secretary general Pagan Amum stating: "Today we shall raise the flag of South Sudan to join the nations of the world". {QuoteLeft|Today we shall raise the flag of South Sudan to join the nations of the world|source=Pagan Amum, {{w|Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement} secretary general}}Thousands of jubilant people celebrated in the new country's capital Juba. They danced in the streets, sang songs and waved flags.  Churches rang their bells at midnight as independence arrived. People crowded to the official ceremonial site, held at the {w|mausoleum} of  {w|John Garang}, leader of the rebellion who died several months after the peace deal was signed with Sudan, ending the bloody conflict. Many of the celebrants spoke emotionally of their family members who died in the long struggle with Sudan.George Garang, an English teacher, said he lost his father, grandfather and eleven brothers. "My whole body feels happy," he said. Valentino Achak Deng, who was a refugee during the war, said: "Really in my heart what makes me happiest is that from today, when people ask me where I am from, I do not have to say Sudan."Kiir insisted that martyrs for the cause of the new country did not die in vain, although South Sudan waited 56 years to be free. The southern Sudanese had agitated for more rights, even before Sudan became free from its British colonizers in 1956. Sudan was divided into three separate demographic groups, with the southern part of the country home to Christians and animists and the northern part dominated by Arab populations and those of Muslim faith. Kiir said to people of {w|Abyei}, Darfur, {w|Blue Nile} and {w|South Kordofan}, who remain part of Sudan, that "we have not forgotten you. When you cry, we cry. When you bleed, we bleed. I pledge to you today that we will find a just peace for all."Amongst those attending the event were Ban Ki-moon, the current {w|Secretary-General of the United Nations} and {w|Omar al-Bashir}, the current president of Sudan. The latter was the guest of honour, despite the fact that the {w|International Criminal Court} has a warrant out for his arrest based on offences of {w|genocide} and {w|Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity} in the Darfur region."We congratulate our brothers in the south for the establishment of their new state," al-Bashir said at the event. "We share their joy and celebration. The will of the people of the south has to be respected."Two million individuals died in the {w|Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war} between the two territories of Sudan and Southern Sudan and four million more exiled,  a war that was waged for decades. Control of south Sudan's oil rich reserves was the primary reason for the fighting. An {w|Comprehensive Peace Agreement|agreement of peace} was signed in  2005, effectively bringing the war to an end, and Sudan became one of the first countries to recognise South Sudan. Under the regulations of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, Sudan held an independence referendum. In excess of 99% of those participating in the vote agreed to the concept of independence for South Sudan. Meanwhile, the United Nations plans to make the independent state its 193rd recognised country and its 54th African U.N. member state. United States president Barack Obama formerly recognized the new nation on behalf of the US and acknowledged the enormous struggle of its people to achieve independence.South Sudan remains a desperately poor country, with one in five of its inhabitants chronically hungry, only one third  having access to safe drinking water and with the world's highest rate of maternal death. The country lacks infrastructure such as roads and railways. It remains  torn by ethnic and tribal rivalries and many problems with the north remain unresolved, including the exact boundary line.  Important revenue for Sudan has come from the rich oilfields of the south, keeping the country afloat and essential now for both economies. A formula remains to be developed on how to split these revenues between the two areas.U.S. ambassador to the U.N. {w|Susan Rice} said today that the peace process between Sudan and North Sudan could come apart if issues  such as the division of the oil revenues and the border location are not solved soon. 
[[China's consumer prices rise to a three-year high in June as food prices soar 14.4 percent]]China's National Bureau of Statistics released data Saturday showing that the {w|consumer price index} for June climbed 6.4% from a year ago. That compares with a 5.5% rise in May, which was the largest since a 6.3% increase in July 2008.  The major factor contributing to this figure was the steep rise in food prices which climbed 14.4%. {w|Pork} is a major food staple in China, and its price rose 65% from last year.Analysts predicted that China's {w|inflation} would peak in June, but particularly worrisome was the steep rise in the cost of food from the same time last year and up from 11.7% in May, indicating that Beijing may have difficulty in controlling inflation. China is the world's second largest economy, having grown robustly in the last two years driven by a {w|Chinese economic stimulus program|2009 governmental stimulus package} of $586 billion and low interest rates offered by  state-owned banks. These were directed at promoting investments in real estate construction and government infrastructure projects, enabling China to lead the global recovery after the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market led to a worldwide recession.Now Beijing is attempting to slow its fast pace of growth, fearful of inflation, by restricting bank lending and raising interest rates. High inflation along with high property values could hurt the economy. Since October, China¡¯s Central Bank has raised interest rates five times. Many factors are contributing to China's inflation, including higher wages for migrant workers, increases in the prices of food and gasoline, as well as diminished output from crucial agricultural areas cause by {w|drought}s and flooding this spring. Today, China's Premier {w|Wen Jiabao} indicated that the war on inflation was continuing and controlling inflation was a top priority for the government, increasing expectations that interest rates would be further increased."We must treat stabilising overall price levels as the top priority of our {w|Macroeconomics|macro-economic} controls and keep the direction of macro-economic adjustments unchanged," Wen said today in comments reported on the central government's website. He had said in March that the ruling {w|Communist Party of China|Communist Party} is worried that a  continuing rise in food prices could result in public protests.Wen said the government would boost the supply of {w|pig|hogs}  to keep the price of pork stable, the price of pork being the major contributor to China's food inflation index and the most closely watched item on it."If they signal any comfort with inflation, and inflation is as high as it is now, they could create an environment in which people would panic, and they can have a real problem on their hands," said Tim Condon, Asian researcher at {w|ING Group|ING}. As markets worried about the news of Chinese inflation as well as concerns about the {w|European debt crisis}, oil dropped below US$95 a barrel today.  == Sources ==

[[Syrian security forces raid Homs, one killed, twenty injured]]Syrian forces have raided the city of {w|Homs, Syria|Homs}, and has killed at least one civilian and injured twenty from machine gunfire and armor activity in heavily populated areas. This raid is reportedly the heaviest since troops were deployed to the city two months ago in an effort to crush dissent against the country's President {w|Bashar al-Assad|Bashar al-Assad}, who's family has ruled the country for 41 years, from ongoing protests.In {w|Hama, Syria|Hama}, which is 50 km north of Homs, Security forces made arrests, and gunshots were reported by activists in the area. No causalities were reported.Demonstrations against the president have spread since ordered tanks into towns and cities where large numbers of protesters appeared. The campaign has been violent, and has claimed the lives of at least 1,400 people since the uprisings began in March, according to human rights groups.The raids on activists comes at a time after the vice-president of the country, {w|Farouq al-Shara} opened "national dialogue" in a attempt to allow discussion on reforms, such as allowing other parties then the ruling {w|Baath Party}. Mostly Assad supporters attended, and opposition groups have boycotted the conference, citing that actions of the security arm of the government and Assad's loyalists continues to operate with impunity.Wikinews and other independent media outlets have been unable to confirm the reports, as Syria has banned international journalists from entering the country.== Sources == 
[[Russian tour boat sinks, killing over 100]]The Russian tour boat Bulgaria, carrying 208 people despite being certified to carry only 120, sank Sunday on Russia's {w|Volga river}.  Yesterday, prosecutors opened a wide ranging investigation into Russia's transportation industry, including an examination of the failure of governmental regulation and safety inspections of the tour boat industry.Around 80 people were saved and perhaps as many as 128 drowned, including up to fifty children caught in a playroom. Children were undocumented passengers who came aboard with their parents.  Rescuers equipped with helicopters are currently looking for survivors, and teams of 50 divers are searching the vessel and  say that people are still trapped inside. But officials hold little hope that more survivors will be found.A day of mourning was declared in Russia yesterday. Riverboats flew their flags at half-mast. Not since 1986, when two ships collided, killing 423 people, has Russia experienced a worse maritime disaster. Summer river cruises are a favorite outing in Russia, but river boats have fallen into disrepair since Soviet times. "We have far too many old ships sailing our waters," President Dmitri Medvedev said on Monday. He  vowed to bring criminal actions against the ship's operator.  Also, two commercial vessels that ignored drowning passengers and did not stop to help are expected to be charged. Yesterday, prosecutors opened an investigation into Russia's transportation industry, including an examination of the failure of governmental regulation and safety inspections of the tour boat industry.The 80m boat  was caught in bad weather on Sunday and sank near {w|Tatarstan} while sailing from {w|Bolgar|Bolgary} to {w|Kazan|Kazaon}, about 750km east of Moscow at a part of the Volga River that is very wide and considered wild. The vessel sank within a few minutes after encountering the storm. According to reports, the double-decker vessel was 56 years old and was in poor condition. One of its two engines failed before it left on its voyage on Sunday and the ship had been listing. The river boat industry lacks adequate regulation and the boats are not given complete safety inspections.== Sources == 
[[Stun gun found on JetBlue flight in Newark, New Jersey]]The cleaning crew of {w|JetBlue Airways} found a stun gun in the back pocket of a seat on a Boston-Newark flight in {w|Newark, New Jersey|Newark}, New Jersey. The gun was reported to the {w|Port Authority of New York and New Jersey}, then handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and {w|Transportation Security Administration}, who is responsible for investigating how the weapon came aboard the aircraft despite intensive security screenings."Obviously it got on the plane somehow," said FBI spokesperson Bryan Travers. "Did it get smuggled through security? Was it brought on some other way? That's why it's under investigation."The FBI have also said that the passenger that was sitting directly in front of the pocket was identified, but has not yet directly tied the passenger to the stun gun, which was described as a covert cellphone type that resembled a smartphone. A K-9 unit inspected the plane for further contraband, but found nothing. There was no indication that the gun was to be used in an attack.== Sources == 
[[Study shows long-term couples more satisfied with relationships and sex lives]]A recently-published international study shows that in long-term couples, men are more satisfied with their relationships, and women are more satisfied with their sex lives. The study, which also says that men enjoy cuddling more than women, was published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour by the {w|Kinsey Institute} in {w|Indiana University Bloomington}. More formally known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, the organization is also known for reporting in the 1940s that young adults were having sex. The report observed more than 1,000 couples from the US, Japan, Germany, Spain, and Brazil. All of the survey participants were aged 40 to 70, and all of the couples had been together for at least a year. The average duration of the relationship was 25 years. Japanese men were more likely to be satisfied with their sex lives than American men, and Japanese and Brazilian women were more likely to be satisfied with their sex lives than American women, though the study did not control for other factors such as age. Women in relationships lasting at least 15 years were more likely to be happy with their sex lives than women in relationships lasting less than 15 years. According to the report's author Julia Heiman, "It's possible that women became more satisfied over time because their expectations change, or life changes when their children grow up."Men who reported regular hugging and kissing in their relationships were three times as happy as those without cuddling. Jennifer Bass, communications director at the Kinsey Institute, says that "this study makes it clear our assumptions aren't always borne out by research," referring to common beliefs that men prefer sex while women prefer cuddling. == Sources == 
[[No single cause of autism, research review concludes]]Many factors of a child's birth and the condition of the newborn are linked to the future development of autism, but no single factor has been identified as the cause, a {w|meta-analysis} of forty previously published research studies concludes.Autism refers to a cluster of neurological developmental disorders, ranging to mild and severe, that interfere the child's ability to adjust normally, including defects in normal communication and social interaction.The systematic review, published in Monday's issue of {w|Pediatrics|Pediatrics},  presented the results of a {w|meta-analysis} of over sixty {w|perinatal} and {w|neonatal} risk factors associated with autism reported in the forty published studies.  It identified sixteen that were  significantly associated with autism. These included {w|low birth weight}, {w|Childbirth#Complications|complications associated with delivery}, fetal distress during labor, "poor condition" of the newborn along with a low {w|Apgar score}, {w|multiple births}, {w|Birth trauma|birth injuries} to the baby, and {w|hemorrhaging} of the mother during childbirth.However,  the review found that often these factors are linked; not occurring independently but in combination, making the effect of any one factor difficult to determine. Further, the conclusions of the studies often were in conflict with each other regarding the relationship of any  single one of the factors to autism. The researcher concluded there was "insufficient evidence to implicate any one perinatal or neonatal factor in autism etiology." However, they said some evidence suggested the presence of  "multiple neonatal complications may increase autism risk."The review also ruled out some factors, finding some were not linked to autism such as the use during childbirth  of {w|anesthesia}, {w|forceps delivery} or {w|vacuum extractor delivery}. High birth weight and  large head circumference of the newborn were also discounted.The researcher who headed the study, Hannah Gardener, who was at the {w|Harvard School of Public Health} at the time and is now at the {w|University of Miami School of Medicine}, emphasized in an interview that parents should not worry if any one of the factors was present at the time of their child's birth. She said, "There is no single strong cause of autism." == Sources == 
[[Ahmad Wali Karzai, brother of Afghan President, shot dead in Kandahar]]President Karzai released a statement after the killing of his brother. He said "This is the way of life for the people of Afghanistan. The homes of all Afghans feel this pain. Our hope is this will come to an end and peace and happiness come to our homes and will come to rule in our country."The motive as to why Mohammed would have killed Karzai remain unclear, but the Taliban have claimed responsibility for the assassination. Local politician {w|Khaled Pashtun} said he was sceptical about the Taliban's involvement. The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks and killings without evidence of their involvement.Karzai had survived several assassination attempts before. He escaped uninjured after a fuel tanker filled with bombs exploded near a building where he was hosting a meeting in 2008, and again in 2009 when his convoy was attacked by machine guns and rocket attacks.General {w|David Petraeus}, the commander of the {w|International Security Assistance Force}, said "President Karzai is working to create a stronger, more secure Afghanistan, and for such a tragic event to happen to someone within his own family is unfathomable." Another US offical told the BBC, "[Ahmad Wali Karzai] had his unsavoury side, but he was someone we could work with and he kept a lid on things in Kandahar."== Sources == 
[[Ron Paul announces he will not seek U.S. House re-election in 2012; will focus on presidential campaign]]Paul, 75, has held his House seat for {w|Texas's 14th congressional district} since 1997, and previously held another House seat for Texas from 1976 to 1977 and 1979 to 1985.  He ran for president as the {w|Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party}'s nominee in {w|United States presidential election, 1988|1988}, but finished in third place with approximately 0.47 percent of the vote.  Paul later returned to the Republican Party and Congress in the 1990s, and sought the party's 2008 presidential nomination while simultaneously running for re-election in the House. Despite an enthusiastic internet following that broke fundraising records, he lost the nomination to Senator John McCain of Arizona.  Nevertheless, Paul feels better about his chances to win the 2012 nomination, stating "We have a lot more support right now, things are doing well for us."  According to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal Republican presidential poll, Paul is tied with Representative {w|Michele Bachmann} of Minnesota for second place with 11 percent, behind former {w|Governor of Massachusetts|Governor} Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who stands at 43 percent. Paul, who won re-election in 2010 with 76 percent of the vote, commented that his early announcement would give political aspirants plenty of time to decide to run for his seat, which represents ten counties along the {w|Gulf Coast of the United States|Texas Gulf Coast}.== Sources == 
[[Euro reaches new lows]]On Tuesday, the {w|Euro} fell to a new record low in relation to the {w|Swiss Franc}, and to multi-month lows against the {w|United States dollar|U.S. Dollar} and {w|Japanese yen}; all considered by investors to be safe currencies during times of economic turmoil.The {w|Wall Street Journal} reported earlier that recent comments from the newly installed head of the International Monetary Fund, France¡¯s {w|Christine Lagarde}, resulted in a sell-off of the Euro.  At a roundtable discussion in Washington, Lagarde noted that the IMF had not yet reached discussion of terms and conditions of a second Greek bailout plan.  In fact, a representative from the IMF is currently meeting with {w|Eurozone} policymakers to draft such a new proposal.  The yield differential between Italian bonds and German bonds has spread to more than 300 basis points, something not seen in over a decade and evidence of investors¡¯ concern.Adding to the Euro¡¯s woes is the upcoming release of the bank stress tests on Friday.  The European Bankers Association said that they expect the data release to shed new light on the Eurozone¡¯s banking situation.  Representatives of several of the Eurozone¡¯s governments, including Germany, have requested that the association consider releasing fewer specific details for fear that investor panic will ensue.  The inadequacy of the capitalization rates has been an issue with the {w|European Central Bank}, whose president recently called upon Eurozone banks to make every effort to put their balance sheets in order.  For the time being at least, an unsubstantiated rumor reported by the Wall Street Journal states that the Eurozone¡¯s central banks' purchase of periphery debt has helped to quell the downward momentum of the Euro.== Sources ==

[[21 people killed and 113 reported injured in three blasts in Mumbai]]Three blasts occurred in Mumbai Wednesday evening in one of the busiest areas of the city. It has been estimated that 21 people have been killed and up to 113 injured. According to a regional government official, Prithviraj Chavan, the explosions were "a co-ordinated attack by terrorists."The first blast took place in South Mumbai's {w|Zaveri Bazar} at 1854 local time, in which several were injured. Here, a motorcycle had a bomb attached to it that exploded next to a jewelry shop. According to eyewitnesses, fire broke out immediately after the blast. The second explosion happened  at the {w|Opera House} in {w|Charni Road} within a few minutes of the first one. This was the most powerful explosion, caused by a bomb that blew up inside a building. The third one took place in Dadar at 1905 local time, where a taxi was rigged for the purpose. All three of the locations are commercial and residential areas with busy streets and heavy traffic.According to an eyewitness to the Zaveri Bazar explosion, "[b]odies and limbs were strewn everywhere. People were crying and screaming. The area was packed with shoppers at the time of the blast. A few offered assistance to the blood-soaked victims, while others looked on in a state of shock."The home ministry put the National Security Guard on alert following the blasts in Mumbai.
[[Lizards are capable of problem-solving, study shows]]A tropical  tree-dwelling lizard has succeeded  in a problem-solving test by learning to associate the color of a cap with a food reward, contesting the stereotype that reptiles are extremely limited cognitively compared to birds and mammals. The cognitive abilities of reptiles have rarely been studied.In a color discriminating task, the lizards learned to flip over the correctly colored cap to reveal a worm hidden underneath.  The experiment was conducted at {w|Duke University} and the results, published in the {w|Biology Letters|Royal Society journal Biology Letters}, suggest that the problem-solving abilities of reptiles may be greater than previously thought.  The Puerto Rican lizard,, used in the study,  is a well-studied species, known to excel at foraging food  by being acutely aware of movement. Several lizards of this species were collected from Puerto Rico for the experiment.Researches first wanted to determine if the six lizards used in the study were able to figure out how to flip off the cap to obtain the food. The agile reptiles quickly learned to use one of two ways to move the cap: they closed their jaws on the edge of the cap and dragged it off the food, or ran into the cap with their heads, tipping it over and grabbing the food.The lizards were then given a choice between two caps; one was blue and the other was yellow and blue; under only one was the food reward of a worm. They quickly learned to distinguish which cap had the reward."They learned to associate the color of the [cap] with a food reward," said Manual Leal, the Duke University researcher who led the study. Their success on a  test that is based on worms and usually used on birds was "completely unexpected," he said.The lizards solved the problem in fewer tries than birds needed to flip the correct cap and pass the test, Leal explained. Lizards get just one chance per day because they eat less, while birds usually get up to six chances a day. Thus a mistake by a lizard means it must remember until the next day how to correct the mistake, Leal said.And when the color of the caps was switched, after a few mistakes two of the lizards were able to figure out the trick. "We named these two Plato and Socrates,"  said Leal. Jonathan Losos, a biologist at {w|Harvard University} not involved in the study, said Leal's experiment demonstrates that when faced with a new situation, most of the lizards were able to solve the problem. They had the ability to figure out the trick and disregard their previous learning; a sign of a cognitively advanced animal that some mammalian species cannot easily do. The results "should cause researchers to re-evaluate what they think they know about the evolution of animal cognition," Losos said.== Sources ==

[[21 people killed and seventy injured in three blasts in Mumbai]]The title suggests that no single cause exists. This is not supported by the story, it's sources or the research. It is still unknown. There are risk factors which are correlated, but no cause is determined. For all we know crickets song could be the cause.Just look at the titles of the source stories.

[[Drought stricken Somalia nears famine]]The African Union made a plea on Tuesday for the international community to come to the aid of Somalia. This is a country where one in three, is suffering from a severe  {w|drought}, a situation complicated by warring rebel factions. In 2009, {w|UNICEF} discontinued air deliveries to areas controlled by the Islamic insurgent group {w|Al-Shabaab|al-Shabab} due to militant threats. Last week al-Shabab said it would welcome the presence of humanitarian groups, provided aid groups did not have a "hidden agenda".On Wednesday, the United Nations airlifted supplies to a part of the country controlled by al-Shabab, flying five metric tons of medicines, food and water supplies to {w|Baidoa}, a rebel-held  town, 155 miles south of Mogadishu. Maulid Warfa,  UNICEF emergency officer, in an interview with state-run {w|Radio Mogadishu}, said a very critical humanitarian crisis exists in rural communities where people have lost their livestock and farms after the worst drought in six decades. The aid is to help them and their children who are extremely malnourished.When Warfa, was asked  about the arrest of two aid workers by al Shabaab, one with UNICEF, Warfa did not confirm or deny it. Instead he emphasized the desperate need of  Somalians for assistance.Although some feared a new Kenyan camp would result in more Somalis fleeing to Kenya, Kenya has announced in will open a new refuge camp near the Somalian border within ten days which will hold 80,000. Kenyan Prime Minister {w|Raila Odinga} said, "Although we consider our own security, we can't turn away the refugees."In a nearby refugee camp in Kenya where 370,000 people are squeezed into a space set up for 90,000 people, conditions are desperate aid workers said.Somalia's Prime Minister {w|Abdiweli Mohamed Ali} in an interview with the BBC said  a refugee camp has opened  in Mogadishu, but that the government had "meagre" resources to help drought victims. "We are appealing to the international community to take the matter seriously and to act quickly to save as many lives as we can," he told the BBC.On Thursday, UNICEF said Somalia's drought and refugee crisis is "the most severe humanitarian emergency in the world."On Friday, Jens Oppermann, the country director of {w|Action Against Hunger}, told {w|Agence France-Presse|AFP}: "We are no longer talking about a humanitarian crisis or a humanitarian emergency. We are seeing this as a humanitarian catastrophe."This is the second consecutive year the summer rains have not come, and according to the BBC,  the current drought threatens the lives of at least four million in Somalia.

[[Rebekah Brooks resigns from News International]]¡°I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place," Brooks, who formerly edited the NotW, said in a statement. Her resignation came amid mounting pressure from politicians for her resignation, and after {w|Rupert Murdoch} dropped his bid to take full control of {w|BSkyB} following growing public anger.David Cameron, the British prime minister, said Brooks had made the ¡°right decision¡± to leave her post. His spokesperson said: "Clearly there have been mistakes made. There are a lot of questions to answer.¡± {w|Ed Miliband}, the leader of the {w|Labour party|Labour party} also welcomed the decision. ¡°No one in this country should exercise power without responsibility,¡± he said. ¡°[But] this is not just about one individual but about the culture of an organisation.¡±Her resignation came as it emerged the FBI had launched an investigation into the alleged hacking of relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks on the United States by journalists at the NotW. The move amounts to the first time the scandal has spread outside of Britain, and analysts predict it might have widespread consequences for Murdoch.Murdoch, the media giant at the head of {w|News Corporation}, the parent company of News International, has so far stood by Brooks. Analysts say the pressure for her resignation came to a head on Thursday night as {w|Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud}, the {w|Saudi} prince who owns the second largest {w|stakeholding|stake} in News Corporation, questioned her ¡°integrity¡±. He told the BBC: "For sure she has to go, you bet she has to go."His comments followed the arrests of a number of NotW editors and reporters, and the closing of the tabloid in reaction to the phone hacking scandal that has erupted in the last two weeks following allegations that the voicemail of abducted and murdered teenager {w|Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly Dowler} was hacked into. It has also emerged that journalists at the NotW had been involved in the hacking of phones belonging to victims of the {w|7/7 attacks} in London and relatives of British soldiers killed in combat in Afghanistan.In an interview with the {w|Wall Street Journal}, Murdoch has defended his handling of the scandal. "The company has made mistakes,¡± he said. ¡°It is not only receiving appropriate scrutiny, but is also responding to unfair attacks by setting the record straight." It has also emerged today that News International is to take out large advertisements in {w|British newspapers} this weekend to apologise for what they describe as ¡°wrongdoings¡± at the NotW. Brooks worked for News International for 22 years and had also edited the daily tabloid paper {w|The Sun}. She will be replaced by {w|Tom Mockridge}, the chief executive of {w|Sky Italia}. Her announcement was made to staff at News International's offices in {w|Wapping} in {w|East London}.

However, 4,400 have been evacuated from the surrounding area as a result of the incident with 28,000 evacuations being recommended in total by a disaster and vulcanology relief centre, aimed at those residing within a three-and-a-half {w|Kilometre|kilometre} radius of the landmark, which was created last weekend. As well as this, the centre has increased the volcano status to its peak level. According to Darwis Sitinjak, a representative of an agency involved with disasters, rescuers - assisted by police officers and soldiers - were evacuating around five hundred inhabitants of the slopes of the mountain, Sitinjak told radio station El Shinta.Lokon, in {w|Sulawesi}, a province located in the north of the country, commenced experiencing a volcanic eruption at approximately 1530 {w|Coordinated Universal Time|UTC} Thursday. According to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, "[t]he eruption has set ablaze the forests around the crater". Kristianto, a volcanologist working for the government of Indonesia, has reported "no mass panic because the community has already been warned of the situation" and the evacuation of residents is ongoing, Kristianto said to {w|Agence France-Presse}. On Wednesday, two thousand other people departed from the area.Out of the 129 volcanoes located in Indonesia, Mount Lokon is considered to be amongst the most active, standing at a peak of 1,580 {w|Metre|metres}. Rocks, lava, smoke, ash and sand were thrown at a height of 1,500 metres, according to Kristianto.

[[Obama raises $35M re-election funds from 244 campaign 'bundlers' since April]]According to figures voluntarily released Friday by the Barack Obama {w|Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|campaign} for the 2012 US presidency, Obama's top donors raised at least $35 million since April of this year by giving the maximum for individuals and compiling contributions from associates. This quarter, Obama raised a total of $86 million jointly with the {w|Democratic National Committee}. He received $20 million from about 600 people who gave the maximum annual individual contribution of $35,800, of which $5,000 goes directly to the campaign.The campaign released the names of the top 244 contributors called "bundlers", typically rich donors who give liberally and gather cash from friends and business contacts. The list of donors included two dozen, including {w|Vogue} chief editor {w|Anna Wintour}, {w|DreamWorks} CEO {w|Jeffrey Katzenberg}, {w|Comcast} executive {w|David L. Cohen}, and former {w|Goldman Sachs} CEO {w|Jon Corzine}, who each raised at least $500,000. Although the campaign points out it has more than 550,000 donors, the list shows the hefty role played by these bundlers in Obama's fundraising. The campaign emphasizes that Obama refuses to accept money from {w|political action committee}s or {w|lobbyist}s in Washington.According to the {w|Center for Responsive Politics}, Obama raised $76.5 million from 560 bundlers for his 2008 presidential run. "Bundlers are the biggest players supporting a campaign, well beyond just the folks who are maxing out their individual donations," said Dave Levinthal from the Center. "They serve as aggregators of cash, a critical function to a successful fundraising operation."About 80 percent of Obama's biggest donors from {w|Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|his 2008 campaign}, those that raised $500,000 or more, were appointed to what the White House calls "key administration posts," according to a report released Friday by {w|The Center for Public Integrity}. In that campaign,  Obama had 47 bundlers  who raised at least $500,000. He is already half way to reaching this number with the two dozen contributing from April through June, according to {w|The Washington Post}. The {w|White House} denied that donations had anything to do with these appointments. According to {w|White House Press Secretary} {w|Jay Carney}, "The people who got those positions got them because of their credentials.  They also happen to be donors in some cases. ... Being a supporter does not qualify you for a job or guarantee you a job, but it does not disqualify you."

[[US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticizes Turkey over human rights concerns]]United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Saturday that the recent actions by Turkey to arrest and detain journalists in the country, as well as planned Internet restrictions, are "an area of concern" for her.Clinton is on a two-day visit to Turkey and made some of her comments during a news conference on the Turkish {w|CNN} channel during an event where she answered questions from Turkish citizens. Answering a question regarding the issue, she said that "I do not think it¡¯s necessary or in Turkey's interests to be cracking down on journalists and bloggers and the Internet [...] it seems to me inconsistent with all the other advances that Turkey has made."In a press conference jointly held with {w|Ahmet Davutoglu}, Turkey's foreign minister, Clinton suggested that Turkey could serve as an example for Arab countries currently undergoing governmental changes. She said that "people in the Middle East and North Africa are seeking to draw lessons from Turkey's experience" and that "democratic development also depends on responsible leadership."According to Turkish media groups, upwards of 60 journalists are being held based on dubious evidence, though government officials say that only 26 are imprisoned, all on charges separate from their activities in the media. In some recent arrests, authorities have cited anti-terror laws as justification. Separately, the government plans next month to place filters on Internet traffic in the country, which could allow for monitoring of individual users. Such human rights concerns have long served as a stumbling block for Turkey's attempts to join the European Union.== Sources == 
[[Space Shuttle Atlantis landing concludes program]]Space Shuttle Atlantis has completed its last journey with a landing at {w|Kennedy Space Center}, located in Florida, United States. Two thousand employees, including employees, families and friends, witnessed the landing of Atlantis at 0557 {w|Eastern Time Zone|EDT} yesterday. This landing has brought mission {w|STS-135} to a close, as well as the {w|Space Shuttle program} from NASA. The program, which experienced a total of one hundred and thirty-five missions, had been in operation for thirty years, since 1981.During the landing, {w|Christopher Ferguson}, the flight's commander, commented that "[t]he space shuttle changed the way we view the world and it changed the way we view the universe". Citing "a lot of emotion" in relation to this landing, Ferguson clarified that "one thing's indisputable: America's not going to stop exploring".Amongst the aftermath of the landing, {w|Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA Administrator} {w|Charles F. Bolden, Jr.} produced a speech while standing in front of the spacecraft and its crew and spoke of "the rare opportunity to witness history". Atlantis launched for the final time on July 8 this year. Bolden commented: "This final shuttle flight marks the end of an era, but today we recommit ourselves to continuing human spaceflight and taking the necessary and difficult steps to ensure America's leadership in human spaceflight for years to come."The {w|Government of the United States|United States government} gave the order to abandon the program, partially attributing their cancellation to the expense of vehicle maintenance. Due to the program's conclusion, in excess of three thousand space shuttle operation contributions are now anticipated to lose their occupations. Bolden spoke of how grateful NASA were to the "thousands, literally tens of thousands, of folks all around the country who made all this possible". There is now no way for individuals to travel into space from the United States. To do this, NASA will utilise the services of the Russian spacecraft {w|Soyuz|Soyuz}.

[[Arrests and resignations as probe into Britain's phone hacking scandal widens]]Further arrests and resignations have occurred related to the News International phone hacking scandal.  {w|Rebekah Brooks}, former executive with {w|Rupert Murdoch}'s British newspaper division of {w|News Corporation}, was arrested Sunday and released on bail 12 hours later. Her arrest came amid allegations that the {w|News of the World} illegally hacked into 4,000 individual cell phones. Brooks resigned from her position on Friday. Hers was the tenth arrest connected to the scandal.The scandal has now caused two high profile resignations at the Metropolitan Police. On Sunday  Sir {w|Paul Stephenson|Paul Stephenson}, commissioner  of Metropolitan Police Service, resigned from his post, taking responsibility for the agency's failure to investigate all alleged criminal acts by reporters of News of the World and for the implied close relationship between the police and Murdoch's papers. The investigation of the complaints of phone hacking made by the Royal Family in 2006 was never fully pursued.  He was also criticized for hiring former deputy editor of the NotW {w|Neil Wallis} as a media consultant. Wallis was arrested last week for his part in the scandal.Assistant commissioner {w|John Yates|John Yates}' resignation followed Stephenson's, after it emerged he had inappropriately fostered the hiring of the daughter of his friend Wallis, and failed to pursue an investigation of the NotW in 2009. Yates labelled this action "a pretty crap one".Last night, it was reported that {w|Sean Hoare}, a {w|whistleblower} who  worked for former NotW editor {w|Andy Coulson} and was the first to allege a high ranking-editor had known about phone hacking at the NotW, was found dead at his home. Police say the death is not categorized as "suspicious" although it is unexplained. The BBC reported that Hoare had suffered from an unspecified illness. He was let go from NotW in 2005  for problems related to substance abuse.The revelations are the latest in a growing scandal that has so far led to the resignations of a number of News Corporation executives, including {w|Les Hinton}, the publisher of the US newspaper {w|The Wall Street Journal}, on Friday. The scandal has also led Murdoch to close the NotW and drop his bid to take full control of broadcaster {w|BSkyB}. Pressure grew on Murdoch when it was alleged journalists at the NotW had hacked into the phone of missing schoolgirl {w|Milly Dowler}, British families of victims of the {w|9/11 terrorist attacks} and relatives of British soldiers killed in Afghanistan.David Cameron, the {w|British prime minister}, is scheduled to return from his trip to Africa two days early in order to deal with the scandal that has shaken the public's trust in the police, journalists and politicians. Cameron has been under pressure to apologise for his appointment of Coulson¡ªwho was arrested two weeks ago¡ªas a media adviser after his resignation as editor of the NotW.

Roemer, who had explored a bid for the past several months, wants to focus his campaign on the issues of campaign finance reform and fair trade.Roemer, 67, served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1980s as a member of the {w|Democratic Party|Democratic Party}. He was {w|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1987|elected} governor in 1987 and served once again as a Democratic Party member before switching to the Republican Party ahead of the {w|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1991|1991 gubernatorial election}.

[[British painter Lucian Freud dies aged 88]]Freud, the elder brother of the late comedic writer and broadcaster {w|Clement Freud}, was born in Berlin in 1922 and moved with his family to Britain in 1933 to escape the {w|Nazism|Nazis}. He became a British citizen in 1939. He studied at the {w|Central School of Art}, then at the {w|East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing} with {w|Cedric Morris}. He also attended {w|Goldsmiths, University of London}. After finishing art school, he spent some time in the merchant navy. In 1944, he started exhibiting with a solo showcase at the Alex Reid & Lefevre Gallery.In the 1950s, his style changed to exclusively paint portraits and nudes. The process of painting for models was intense: one nude painting took 16 months to complete and Freud demanded her turn up almost every day to pose. His work was nominated for the {w|Turner Prize} in 1989, and he was a member of the {w|Order of Merit}. Most controversially, he painted a portrait of {w|Queen Elizabeth II} which was described by {w|The Sun|The Sun} newspaper as a "travesty", and prompted Robin Simon, the editor of the {w|British Art Journal} to say that "It makes her look like one of the royal corgis who has suffered a stroke". He also famously painted the glamour model {w|Kate Moss} nude, and was once named one of Britain's best dressed men in the magazine {w|GQ}.His work has sold for large amounts: Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, sold in 2008 at {w|Christie's} in New York for $33.6 million dollars. In addition, he has had solo shows at some of the most prominent art galleries and museums in the world including the {w|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles}, the {w|Museum of Modern Art} in New York, and the {w|Centre Pompidou} in Paris. {w|Nicholas Serota}, the director of the {w|Tate} in London, said of Freud: "The vitality of his nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late twentieth century art. His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period."Freud has at least thirteen children from a series of marriages and affairs: after an affair wth the {w|Bloomsbury Group} member {w|Lorna Garman}, Freud married her niece Kitty in 1948 and had two children before ending the marriage four years later. He had an affair with Lady {w|Caroline Blackwood} which turned into a marriage in 1953, although that was dissolved in 1957. He also had two children with Bernadine Coverly, five children with Suzy Boyt, and four children with Katherine Margaret McAdam.== Sources == 
[[At least 85 dead in shooting at Norwegian youth camp]]A gunman, identified by Norwegian media as {w|Anders Behring Breivik}, has shot and killed at least 85 people at a youth camp on the island of {w|Ut?ya} in Norway. The 32-year-old man has been charged with both this attack and an explosion in the capital city of {w|Oslo}, which killed at least seven people. Police searched Breivik's apartment in Oslo overnight and have been interrogating him.Breivik is reported to have arrived at the camp dressed as a police officer, telling children to gather around him for protection before systematically shooting them. It is not yet known whether he acted alone; police say there are no concrete reports of a second gunman, but this cannot be ruled out.The camp was organised by the {w|Workers' Youth League|Workers' Youth League}, which is affiliated with the {w|Labour Party|Norwegian Labour Party}. A number of sources, both inside and outside of Norway, are speculating that an opposition to the Labour Party's immigration policies, especially regarding Muslims, was Breivik's motivation for the attacks.Islam is the second largest religion in Norway, after Christianity, and Breivik's comments on the political website Document.no, where he posted using his real name between September 2009 and October 2010, expressed anti-Islamic sentiments. He described the religion as a hate ideology and compared it to {w|Nazism}. His Twitter account was used to post only a single comment, quoting {w|social liberal} philosopher {w|John Stuart Mill}: "One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100 000 who have only interests".

Passengers cried for help but no crew responded."The government have said they will be launching an "urgent overhaul" of rail safety following the crash, the first derailment since the introduction of 155 miles per hour high-speed rail service in China four years ago, and three railway officials were also fired by the ministry of railways, which said the officials may be investigated.On Sunday, rescuers found a small child unconscious in the wreckage, about 21 hours after the crash, who was sent to a hospital. According to a rescue worker, the child, four years old, "could still move his hands" when he was located.== Sources == 
[[Protests over housing costs sweep across Israel]]Israelis have been gathering across the country to protest against the rising costs of housing, with "tent cities" being erected in {w|Tel Aviv}, {w|Jerusalem}, {w|Beersheba}, {w|Haifa}, and {w|Kiryat Shemona}. On Saturday night tens of thousands marched from the encampment on Tel Aviv's {w|Rothschild Boulevard}, which has been a focal point for the protestors, to the Tel Aviv Museum.Rents in Tel Aviv are said to have risen by over 60 percent in four years. Buying costs have soared too, with estate agent Eli Melloul stating that the average price for an Israeli apartment has now reached 1 million shekels. The demonstrators are urging the government to intervene and help reduce prices. Prime Minister {w|Benjamin Netanyahu} has pledged swift action, including streamlining planning and building regulations, and constructing 6,000 housing units. However none of these units are set for Tel Aviv. Some are calling for him to resign over the issue, and several members of the {w|Knesset} also joined Saturday's march.The protests have largely been composed of young people and students, organised using social media such as Facebook. They follow a recent Facebook campaign to boycott cottage cheese, which succeeded in driving down prices. Elderly people have also begun to join the movement to show their solidarity.Daphni Leef, credited with starting the protest movement, addressed the crowd at Tel Aviv Museum. "Under these conditions we will soon have no dreams", she said. "There is no time to dream when you're constantly looking to cover your rent. There's no time to dream when you're constantly looking to cover a mortgage."She also blamed Netanyahu personally in her speech: "You, Bibi, with your wild policy and your irresponsibility, you pushed us into a nadir. You, Mr. Netanyahu, caused us ¨C the Facebook generation ¨C to head to the streets and protest."

He joined the {w|Communism|Communist} resistance at the age of 16 but was later sent abroad by the French controlled government to train as a pilot. He never saw any military combat. After the French were defeated and the country was divided in 1954, Ky fled south and joined the South Vietnamese Air Force, backed by the Americans.In 1965, at the age of 34, Ky became the Prime Minister of South Vietnam. He held the post up until 1967 when he became Vice President under {w|Nguyen Van Thieu}. When Communist troops began to attack {w|Saigon}, Ky fled to an American Naval ship and moved to the United States in 1975.While in America, he opened up his own liquor store. After being accused of corruption back in his home country he spoke out saying ¡°If I had stolen millions of dollars I could live like a king in this country, but obviously I don¡¯t live like a king.¡± He later said in his book, ¡°When a former national leader becomes a storekeeper, it is news.¡±In 2004 he returned to the spotlight when, at the offer of the Communist government he became the highest-ranking former South Vietnamese official to return to the country.Many Vietnamese-born people who fled to America around the same time as Ky have spoke about his death. Political activist Ky Ngo remarked "The overwhelming thought in the community was he was a traitor and most Vietnamese did not trust him. Anyone can go back to the homeland, that's fine, but when you go and openly support the communist movement and criticize the former South Vietnam's government, you lose respect." == Sources ==

[[Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile acknowledges 'error' for using 'hooded delinquent' videos in news programme]]Leonidas Montes, president of the executive board of Chilean television channel {w|Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile} said on Tuesday in a statement to the Chilean Journalists Association that he acknowledged the channel had "commited an error" when it used videos of 'hooded delinquents' to present reports on the on-going student protests in the country, on TVN's news programme 24 Horas. The statement was released the day after more than 60 university students attempted to interrupt the broadcasting of 24 Horas; the students accused the "channel of all Chileans" to "not giving enough coverage to the student protests, and for supporting the Government in education-related news."Online newspaper Otra Prensa! reported on July 13 that TVN had, at least three times, used videos of a 'hooded delinquent' to present reports on the student protests: on June 14, 26; and July 11. The journalists presenting the reports were, chronologically, Amaro G¨®mez-Pablos, Gonzalo Ram¨ªrez, and Consuelo Saavedra. "The picture simply is not part of the news, it isn't necessary to use ink to note the evident political purpose it's following," Otra Prensa!'s editor Luis Cuello wrote on July 13. The online newspaper also cited the 17th Article of the Code of Ethics of the Chilean Journalists Association: "The graphic material and the headlines should also be concordant with the texts provided, so the reader, viewer or listener isn't inducted into confusion or deception." The online newspaper denounced the use of the videos before the Chilean Journalists Association on July 14; vice-president of the association, Giacomo Marasso, said on Twitter that TVN was "evidently trying to distort information;" while Marcelo Castillo, president of the association told Cambio 21 that "[TVN] is trying to reduce the students protests only to what is doing a group of 'hooded delinquents'. TVN is the channel of all the Chileans, it just cannot give this kind of messages." Additionally, that same day, Javiera Montecinos, student of the {W|University of Concepci¨®n} denounced Televisi¨®n Nacional before the Consejo Nacional de Televisi¨®n for the misuse of images against the student protests; the organization accepted the denouncement.Aside, Mayor of Santiago, {w|Pablo Zalaquett} linked the student protests with the increase of the delinquency in the city. "It is related to the occupations of schools, high schools and universities, and the mass marches," adding that it was "conflictive" that there were "so many youngsters without classes [...] A youngster in the street can be tempted to do whatever thing."The Chilean Journalists Association said on Tuesday that the Code of Ethics "explicitly sanctions this kind of manipulation [of the information]," and that members of the association are going to present the case to the Ethics Tribunal of the same organization. "We appreciate the attitude of the board of TVN, but we will pay attention to the fulfillment of basic ethical standards for the exercise of the profession," Marcelo Castillo said.
[[Wikinews interviews Andy Martin, U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate]]Martin has questioned the validity of the birth certificate released by {w|President of the United States|U.S. President} Barack Obama, and is best known for his role in the spreading of rumors that Obama is a Muslim. According to CNN, Martin has retracted the Muslim claim and now believes that Obama was fathered by journalist and labor activist {w|Frank Marshall Davis} rather than Kenyan economist {w|Barack Obama, Sr.}. He also believes that the Obama presidency has been a failure and has asked for Obama to resign.Martin has run for an assortment of public offices in the past and has previously mounted two presidential campaigns. During the {w|United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election}, he vied unsuccessfully for the {w|Democratic Party|Democratic Party}'s presidential nomination, and in {w|United States presidential election, 2000|2000}, he again fell short of winning the nomination of the Republican Party. In other areas, Martin has filed numerous lawsuits, some reportedly with anti-Jewish language. This has caused some commentators such as former White House Press Secretary {w|Robert Gibbs} to label Martin as an {w|Antisemitism|anti-Semite}. Martin vehemently denies the charge. He has also taken legal action against Wikipedia, which he feels is a propaganda arm of the Obama administration.While focusing his presidential campaign in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, Martin has largely emphasized local issues. On national issues, he has taken {w|Conservatism in the United States|conservative} stances, as documented on his campaign website and blog.According to {w|The New York Times}, Martin first spread the 'Obama is a Muslim' rumor via press release following then-Senate candidate Obama's {w|2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|2004 keynote address} to the {w|2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention}. Amid the 2008 presidential election, Martin traveled to Hawaii to investigate Obama, who was at the time, the Democratic Party nominee for president. In October 2008, he filed a lawsuit against the state to release Obama's birth certificate, but it was dismissed by the courts. After returning from the trip, Martin announced that he believed Frank Marshall Davis was Obama's biological father.Martin has been a fierce critic of the Obama administration and held a press conference on August 5 to call for the resignation of both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. He proposed that a "caretaker administration" be put in place until the 2012 election, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as president and a Republican as vice president.Martin was asked several questions about his personal past, which he declined to answer. He refused to discuss his two previous presidential campaigns, his past affiliation with the Democratic Party and would not say which candidates he supported in previous elections. When pressed, Martin stated that the questions were irrelevant.Martin has centered his campaign in the state of New Hampshire and has discussed local issues. For environmental reasons, he opposes the Northern Pass transmission line, an energy project slated to connect New England to the hydroelectric resources of {w|Hydro-Qu¨¦bec}. When asked if the project was under the purview of the office of the presidency, he replied that it requires a {w|presidential finding}. On July 28, Martin released a press release that described a planned march against the Northern Pass as "what could be the largest campaign event generated by any presidential candidate in New Hampshire during the 2012 election cycle." When asked to go into detail about the event, Martin responded that it was "too time consuming" to provide "personalized analysis" but remarked that "I'd say we are surprising a lot of people and we have many more rabbits to pull out of the hat as the campaign progresses."Martin has not been invited to any {w|Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|Republican primary presidential debates} and has not been included in any {w|Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2012|presidential preference polls}.   On his campaign website, Martin describes himself as a supporter of the {w|Second Amendment to the United States Constitution} in opposition to stringent {w|gun control}. He opposes {w|American Clean Energy and Security Act|Cap and Trade legislation} and mandated health care coverage. He identifies himself as a proponent of the {w|First Amendment to the United States Constitution} and a "corruption fighter". He writes about his issue positions on his personal blog.Martin was asked to elaborate his answers on some of the questions, but did not respond. He labeled certain questions as "bizarre".
[[National Museum of Scotland reopens after three-year redevelopment]]Today sees the reopening of the {w|National Museum of Scotland} following a three-year renovation costing {w|GBP|?}47.4 million. Edinburgh's Chambers Street was closed to traffic for the morning, with the 10am reopening by eleven-year-old Bryony Hare, who took her first steps in the museum, and won a competition organised by the local {w|Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News} paper to be a VIP guest at the event. Prior to the opening, Wikinews toured the renovated museum, viewing the new galleries, and some of the 8,000 objects inside.{Picture select L|noborder=yes|width=205px | | | | | | | | | | | }Dressed in {w|Victorian fashion|Victorian} attire, Scottish broadcaster {w|Grant Stott} acted as master of ceremonies over festivities starting shortly after 9am. The packed street cheered an animatronic {w|Tyrannosaurus Rex} created by Millenium FX; onlookers were entertained with a twenty-minute performance by the Mugenkyo {w|Taiko} Drummers on the steps of the museum; then, following Bryony Hare knocking three times on the original doors to ask that the museum be opened, the ceremony was heralded with a specially composed fanfare ¨C played on a replica of the museum's 2,000-year-old {w|carnyx} {w|Celts|Celtic} war-horn. During the fanfare, two {w|abseil|abseilers} unfurled white pennons down either side of the original entrance.The completion of the opening to the public was marked with Chinese firecrackers, and fireworks, being set off on the museum roof. As the public crowded into the museum, the Mugenkyo Taiko Drummers resumed their performance; a street theatre group mingled with the large crowd, and the animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex entertained the thinning crowd of onlookers in the centre of the street.On Wednesday, the museum welcomed the world's press for an in depth preview of the new visitor experience. Wikinews was represented by Brian McNeil, who is also Wikimedia UK's interim liaison with {w|Museum Galleries Scotland}.  The new pavement-level Entrance Hall saw journalists mingle with curators. The director, Gordon Rintoul, introduced presentations by Gareth Hoskins and Ralph Applebaum, respective heads of the Architects and Building Design Team; and, the designers responsible for the rejuvenation of the museum.Describing himself as a "local lad", Hoskins reminisced about his grandfather regularly bringing him to the museum, and pushing all the buttons on the numerous interactive exhibits throughout the museum. Describing the nearly 150-year-old museum as having become "a little tired", and a place "only visited on a rainy day", he commented that many international visitors to Edinburgh did not realise that the building was a public space; explaining the focus was to improve access to the museum ¨C hence the opening of street-level access ¨C and, to "transform the complex", focus on "opening up the building", and "creating a number of new spaces [...] that would improve facilities and really make this an experience for 21st century museum visitors".Hoskins explained that a "rabbit warren" of storage spaces were cleared out to provide street-level access to the museum; the floor in this "crypt-like" space being lowered by 1.5 metres to achieve this goal. Then Hoskins handed over to Applebaum, who expressed his delight to be present at the reopening.Applebaum commented that one of his first encounters with the museum was seeing "struggling young mothers with two kids in strollers making their way up the steps", expressing his pleasure at this being made a thing of the past. Applebaum explained that the Victorian age saw the opening of museums for public access, with the National Museum's earlier incarnation being the "College Museum" ¨C a "first window into this museum's collection". {Commons donate right|Have you any photos of the museum, or its exhibits?} The museum itself is physically connected to the {w|University of Edinburgh}'s old college via a bridge which allowed students to move between the two buildings.Applebaum explained that the museum will, now redeveloped, be used as a social space, with gatherings held in the Grand Gallery, "turning the museum into a social convening space mixed with knowledge". Continuing, he praised the collections, saying they are "cultural assets [... Scotland is] turning those into real cultural capital", and the museum is, and museums in general are, providing a sense of "social pride".McNeil joined the yellow group on a guided tour round the museum with one of the staff. Climbing the stairs at the rear of the Entrance Hall, the foot of the Window on the World exhibit, the group gained a first chance to see the restored Grand Gallery. This space is flooded with light from the glass ceiling three floors above, supported by 40 cast-iron columns. As may disappoint some visitors, the fish ponds have been removed; these were not an original feature, but originally installed in the 1960s ¨C supposedly to humidify the museum; and failing in this regard. But, several curators joked that they attracted attention as "the only thing that moved" in the museum.The museum's original architect was Captain {w|Francis Fowke}, also responsible for the design of London's {w|Royal Albert Hall}; his design for the then-Industrial Museum apparently inspired by {w|Joseph Paxton}'s {w|Crystal Palace}.The group moved from the Grand Gallery into the Discoveries Gallery to the south side of the museum. The old red staircase is gone, and the Millennium Clock stands to the right of a newly-installed escalator, giving easier access to the upper galleries than the original staircases at each end of the Grand Gallery. Two glass elevators have also been installed, flanking the opening into the Discoveries Gallery and, providing disabled access from top-to-bottom of the museum.The National Museum of Scotland's origins can be traced back to 1780 when the 11th Earl of Buchan, David Stuart Erskine, formed the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland; the Society being tasked with the collection and preservation of archaeological artefacts for Scotland. In 1858, control of this was passed to the government of the day and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland came into being. Items in the collection at that time were housed at various locations around the city.On Wednesday, October 28, 1861, during a royal visit to Edinburgh by {w|Queen Victoria}, Prince-Consort {w|Albert, Prince Consort|Albert} laid the foundation-stone for what was then intended to be the Industrial Museum. Nearly five years later, it was the second son of Victoria and Albert, {w|Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred}, the then-{w|Duke of Edinburgh}, who opened the building which was then known as the Scottish Museum of Science and Art. A full-page feature, published in the following Monday's issue of {w|The Scotsman} covered the history leading up to the opening of the museum, those who had championed its establishment, the building of the collection which it was to house, and {w|Edinburgh University}'s donation of their {w|Natural History} collection to augment the exhibits put on public display.The extensive work, carried out with a view to expand publicly accessible space and display more of the museums collections, carried a ?47.4 million pricetag. This was jointly funded with ?16 million from the Scottish Government, and ?17.8 million from the {w|Heritage Lottery Fund}. Further funds towards the work came from private sources and totalled ?13.6 million. Subsequent development, as part of the longer-term ?70 million "Masterplan", is expected to be completed by 2020 and see an additional eleven galleries opened.The funding by the Scottish Government can be seen as a 'canny' investment; a report commissioned by National Museums Scotland, and produced by consultancy firm Biggar Economics, suggest the work carried out could be worth ?58.1 million per year, compared with an estimated value to the economy of ?48.8 prior to the 2008 closure. Visitor figures are expected to rise by over 20%; use of function facilities are predicted to increase, alongside other increases in local hospitality-sector spending.Proudly commenting on the Scottish Government's involvement {w|Fiona Hyslop}, Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, described the reopening as, "one of the nation¡¯s cultural highlights of 2011" and says the rejuvenated museum is, "[a] must-see attraction for local and international visitors alike". Continuing to extol the museum's virtues, Hyslop states that it "promotes the best of Scotland and our contributions to the world."So-far, the work carried out is estimated to have increased the public space within the museum complex by 50%. Street-level storage rooms, never before seen by the public, have been transformed into new exhibit space, and pavement-level access to the buildings provided which include a new set of visitor facilities. Architectural firm Gareth Hoskins have retained the original Grand Gallery ¨C now the first floor of the museum ¨C described as a "birdcage" structure and originally inspired by {w|The Crystal Palace} built in {w|Hyde Park, London} for the 1851 {w|The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition}.The centrepiece in the Grand Gallery is the "Window on the World" exhibit, which stands around 20 metres tall and is currently one of the largest installations in any UK museum. This showcases numerous items from the museum's collections, rising through four storeys in the centre of the museum. Alexander Hayward, the museums Keeper of Science and Technology, challenged attending journalists to imagine installing "teapots at thirty feet".The redeveloped museum includes the opening of sixteen brand new galleries. Housed within, are over 8,000 objects, only 20% of which have been previously seen.The arrangement of galleries around the Grand Gallery's "birdcage" structure is organised into themes across multiple floors. The World Cultures Galleries allow visitors to explore the culture of the entire planet; Living Lands explains the ways in which our natural environment influences the way we live our lives, and the beliefs that grow out of the places we live - from the {w|Arctic} cold of North America to Australia's deserts.The adjacent Patterns of Life gallery shows objects ranging from the everyday, to the unusual from all over the world. The functions different objects serve at different periods in peoples' lives are explored, and complement the contents of the Living Lands gallery.Performance & Lives houses musical instruments from around the world, alongside masks and costumes; both rooted in long-established traditions and rituals, this displayed alongside contemporary items showing the interpretation of tradition by contemporary artists and instrument-creators.The museum proudly bills the Facing the Sea gallery as the only one in the UK which is specifically based on the cultures of the {w|South Pacific}. It explores the rich diversity of the communities in the region, how the sea shapes the islanders' lives ¨C describing how their lives are shaped as much by the sea as the land.Both the Facing the Sea and Performance & Lives galleries are on the second floor, next to the new exhibition shop and foyer which leads to one of the new exhibition galleries, expected to house the visiting Amazing Mummies exhibit in February, coming from {w|Leiden} in the Netherlands.The Inspired by Nature, Artistic Legacies, and Traditions in Sculpture galleries take up most of the east side of the upper floor of the museum. The latter of these shows the sculptors from diverse cultures have, through history, explored the possibilities in expressing oneself using metal, wood, or stone. The Inspired by Nature gallery shows how many artists, including contemporary ones, draw their influence from the world around us ¨C often commenting on our own human impact on that natural world.Contrastingly, the Artistic Legacies gallery compares more traditional art and the work of modern artists. The displayed exhibits attempt to show how people, in creating specific art objects, attempt to illustrate the human spirit, the cultures they are familiar with, and the imaginative input of the objects' creators.The easternmost side of the museum, adjacent to Edinburgh University's Old College, will bring back memories for many regular visitors to the museum; but, with an extensive array of new items. The museum's dedicated taxidermy staff have produced a wide variety of fresh examples from the natural world.Above, in the Animal Senses gallery, are examples of how we experience the world through our senses, and contrasting examples of wildly differing senses, or extremes of such, present in the natural world. This gallery also has giant screens, suspended in the free space, which show footage ranging from the most tranquil and peaceful life in the sea to the tooth-and-claw bloody savagery of nature.The Survival gallery gives visitors a look into the ever-ongoing nature of evolution; the causes of some species dying out while others thrive, and the ability of any species to adapt as a method of avoiding extinction.Earth in Space puts our place in the universe in perspective. Housing Europe's oldest surviving {w|Astrolabe}, dating from the eleventh century, this gallery gives an opportunity to see the technology invented to allow us to look into the big questions about what lies beyond Earth, and probe the origins of the universe and life.In contrast, the Restless Earth gallery shows examples of the rocks and minerals formed through geological processes here on earth. The continual processes of the planet are explored alongside their impact on human life. An impressive collection of geological specimens are complemented with educational multimedia presentations.Beyond working on new galleries, and the main redevelopment, the transformation team have revamped galleries that will be familiar to regular past visitors to the museum.Formerly known as the Ivy Wu Gallery of East Asian Art, the Looking East gallery showcases National Museums Scotland's extensive collection of {w|Korea|Korean}, Chinese, and Japanese material. The gallery's creation was originally sponsored by Sir {w|Gordon Wu}, and named after his wife Ivy. It contains items from the last dynasty, the {w|Manchu}, and examples of traditional ceramic work. Japan is represented through artefacts from ordinary people's lives, expositions on the role of the {w|Samurai}, and early trade with the West. Korean objects also show the country's ceramic work, clothing, and traditional accessories used, and worn, by the indigenous people.The Ancient Egypt gallery has always been a favourite of visitors to the museum. A great many of the exhibits in this space were returned to Scotland from late 19th century excavations; and, are arranged to take visitors through the rituals, and objects associated with, life, death, and the afterlife, as viewed from an Egyptian perspective.The Art and Industry and European Styles galleries, respectively, show how designs are arrived at and turned into manufactured objects, and the evolution of European style ¨C financed and sponsored by a wide range of artists and patrons. A large number of the objects on display, often purchased or commissioned, by Scots, are now on display for the first time ever.Shaping our World encourages visitors to take a fresh look at technological objects developed over the last 200 years, many of which are so integrated into our lives that they are taken for granted. Radio, transportation, and modern medicines are covered, with a retrospective on the people who developed many of the items we rely on daily.What was known as the Museum of Scotland, a modern addition to the classical Victorian-era museum, is now known as the Scottish Galleries following the renovation of the main building.This dedicated newer wing to the now-integrated National Museum of Scotland covers the history of Scotland from a time before there were people living in the country. The geological timescale is covered in the Beginnings gallery, showing continents arranging themselves into what people today see as familiar outlines on modern-day maps.Just next door, the history of the earliest occupants of Scotland are on display; hunters and gatherers from around 4,000 B.C give way to farmers in the Early People exhibits.The Kingdom of the Scots follows Scotland becoming a recognisable nation, and a kingdom ruled over by the Stewart dynasty. Moving closer to modern-times, the Scotland Transformed gallery looks at the country's history post-union in 1707.Industry and Empire showcases Scotland's significant place in the world as a source of heavy engineering work in the form of rail engineering and shipbuilding ¨C key components in the building of the {w|British Empire}. Naturally, whisky was another globally-recognised export introduced to the world during empire-building.Lastly, Scotland: A Changing Nation collects less-tangible items, including personal accounts, from the country's journey through the 20th century; the social history of Scots, and progress towards being a multicultural nation, is explored through heavy use of multimedia exhibits.
[[British police launch computer hacking investigation]]The Metropolitan Police, a British police force based in the capital city of London, has announced its intention to commence a new investigation related to allegations of computer hacking. The force has received numerous allegations of computer and email hacking relating to journalists since January of this year, prompting the launch of the probe, codenamed {w|Operation Tuleta}. According to a spokesperson for Scotland Yard, computer hacking allegations have already been brought into account, but now, "some aspects of that operation are being moved towards investigation".These allegations occurred during {w|Operation Weeting}, which has investigated alleged phone hacking offences. The Metropolitan Police said that the computer hacking claims were not within the remit of the phone hacking allegation probe, so a separate investigation had to be launched. Operation Tuleta consists of a fresh team of detectives, who will provide information to Operation Weeting deputy assistant commissioner {w|Sue Akers}.Meanwhile, the legal representatives for Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator for the former British publication {w|News of the World} have stated that he was proceeding "on the instructions of others". {w|Sara Payne}, the mother of the {w|Murder of Sarah Payne|murdered girl Sarah Payne}, was informed that Mulcaire possibly hacked into her phone and gathered her contact information. Payne was said to be "very distressed and upset" by the allegations. Mulcaire was sentenced to prison in January 2007 along with {w|Clive Goodman}, the royal editor for the NotW.The final edition of the NotW was published this July, amid the phone hacking scandal within News Corporation. A public inquiry relating to the affair was launched, triggered by allegations of phone hacking and police corruption.== Sources == 
[[6.8 earthquake rocks northeastern coast of Papua New Guinea]]The {w|United States Geological Survey} says that a sizeable earthquake has occurred less than 140 kilometres from the Northeastern coast of Papua New Guinea. The initial indication from the USGS is that the earthquake registered at magnitude 6.8 at a depth of just 16.8 kilometres. It struck at 23:38 {w|UTC} offshore between the areas of {w|Wewak}, the capital city of {w|East Sepik} and {w|Madang}, the capital city of the {w|Madang Province}. The {w|Pacific Tsunami Warning Center} issued a minor tsunami warning, stating "[n]o destructive widespread tsunami threat exists based on historical earthquake and tsunami data. However, earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within 100 kilometres of the earthquake epicentre."First reports from the area indicate no casualties and little or no localised damage.== Sources == 
[[More than 100 reported dead after Syrian troops move against protesters]]Syrian troops yesterday launched an offensive against protesters across the nation, resulting in around a hundred deaths in the city of {w|Hama} and several dozen more in other parts of the country.The most severe violence took place in Hama, where government troops and tanks, which had previously remained outside of the city for around a month, moved into the city center beginning at dawn. The crackdown left around a hundred people dead in the city, though exact numbers were unclear.According to the government, the action in Hama was taken in response to the construction of barricades by protesters, though a US embassy official in {w|Damascus} denied the claim. A statement on state news agency {w|Syrian Arab News Agency|SANA} said that protesters had "set police stations on fire, vandalised public and private properties, set roadblocks and barricades and burned tyres at the entrance of Hama" and that "Army units are removing the barricades and roadblocks set by the armed groups at the entrance of the city."Outside of Hama, several dozen more people died in other incidents around the country, leading to reports of a total death toll of 136 people, according to {w|The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph}. In addition to civilian deaths, the government said that five military personnel had been killed.After the events of yesterday, United States president Barack Obama said that he condemned the government's actions, as did officials from the United Kingdom, France and Germany.  Obama also said that the US "will continue to increase our pressure on the Syrian regime, and work with others around the world to isolate the {w|Bashar al-Assad|Assad} government== Sources == 
[[Jenson Button wins Hungarian Grand Prix]]The race was affected by intermittent wet weather, with tyre choice playing a crucial role in the result. Button's teammate {w|Lewis Hamilton} held the lead at times, but suffered from mistimed tyre changes, as well as a spin on lap 47 and a drive through penalty. He was closely followed over the line by {w|Mark Webber} of Red Bull.Four drivers did not finish the race, including {w|Michael Schumacher} whose car suffered a gearbox failure, and {w|Nick Heidfeld}. Heidfeld's Renault overheated during a longer than usual pit-stop, catching fire when emerging from the pit-lane. The driver escaped unhurt, though as marshals were tackling the fire an air bottle on the car exploded. The incident did not affect the rest of the race, with the safety car not being deployed.In 2006, with similar weather conditions, the Hungarian circuit was the scene of Button's first F1 victory. Combining his triumph today with the celebrations of his 200th race, Button quipped that he was looking forward to the drivers' brief holiday before the next race."It¡¯s great to have a couple of weeks break. It might take me that long to get over tonight."
[[US President Obama announces deal reached to avert government default]]United States President Barack Obama announced Sunday night that an agreement between {w|Republican Party|Republican} and {w|Democratic Party|Democratic} leaders has been reached that, if passed by Congress, will allow the government to raise its {w|2011 U.S. debt ceiling crisis|debt limit} before it begins to {w|Sovereign default|default} on its debt on Tuesday.The deal has yet to be approved, with a vote by lawmakers in Congress not likely until Monday at the earliest. Some lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties have previously said that they will not vote for the agreement in question.According to Obama, the deal, agreed upon by leaders of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, will lead to a total of a trillion dollars in spending cuts over the next ten years, as well as the creation of a Congressional committee tasked with coming up with a proposal by November to further reduce the {w|United States public debt|government's debt}.Obama said that "the leaders of both parties in both chambers have reached an agreement that will reduce the deficit and avoid default, a default that would have had a devastating effect on our economy."Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader {w|Mitch McConnell} expressed optimism that Congress will pass the compromise deal. The Senate vote is due on Tuesday.How much support the proposal has in the house is unclear. Democratic leader of the House Nancy Pelosi stated some Democratic members are resistant and are not likely to vote for the proposal.== Sources == 
[[Study observes masturbation and other sexual trends among US teens]]A recently published nationwide survey of US teenagers indicates boys tend to masturbate more ¡ª and start younger ¡ª than girls. It also finds boys who masturbate are more likely to engage in safe sex than boys who don't. Dr. Cynthia L. Robbins, the study's lead author from {w|Indiana University ¨C Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University in Indianapolis}, spoke of the need for the academic community to focus more on masturbation. "Many adolescent boys and girls masturbate, and among sexually active teens masturbation is associated with other sexual behaviors and condom use. It is important to recognize that masturbation is an important and normal component of adolescent sexual development."The survey, named the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, was supported by  {w|Church & Dwight}, which makes {w|Trojan|Trojan} condoms. A representative nationwide sample of 820 teens 14¨C17 years old participated in the study with parental permission. The findings were published Monday in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.Male and female respondents were asked to note how frequently they masturbated in the past three months, the past year, and throughout their lifetime. They were also asked to recall whether they masturbated alone or with a partner, and also how often they used condoms. Nearly three-fourths of boys reported having masturbated, compared to only less than half of girls. About half of boys reported masturbating twice or more per week, also higher than the 23 percent of girls. Masturbation rates for both genders increased along with age, though only boys were more likely to report having "recently" engaged in the activity as they grew older. Among adolescents who engage in oral or vaginal sex, boys who masturbate were eight times more likely to use a condom than boys who don't. A similar correlation was not observed for girls. The researchers who conducted the study urge more open and educational discussion of this highly stigmatized topic. "The findings of this study together with existing publications on masturbation should be used by health care providers to inform, educate and reassure adolescents about masturbation to provide competent and comprehensive sexuality education in the clinical setting".== Sources == 
[[Yani Tseng captures Women's British Open title for a record fifth major]]The Ricoh {w|Women's British Open|Women's British Open} is one of four designated major championships on the {w|LPGA Tour} and the final such tournament on the {w|2011 LPGA Tour|2011 schedule}.Korean {w|Meena Lee} led the first round, played on Thursday, July 28, with a score of 65. The 29-year-old Lee, a two time winner on the LPGA Tour, hit seven birdies and no bogeys despite playing in the worst weather of the day. Constant rain did not seem to disrupt her game as other players struggled.She started her round by making a birdie at the very first hole. She followed with birdies on all three par five holes and on the par four seventh, ninth, and short 11th holes. On the last hole she got a lucky break when her badly-hit approach shot fell short, and jumped across the Barry Burn to stop three feet from the hole; she missed her birdie chance.Two shots behind Lee was 2009 Kraft Nabisco Championship winner {w|Brittany Lincicome} of the US. The American started her round much earlier than the eventual leader and took advantage of more favorable weather conditions. She was at even par after 11 holes with two birdies and two bogeys but things turned for the better and she made two consecutive birdies followed by an eagle on the 14th hole. Lincicome hit another on the 17th hole to seal her final score.Another shot behind were four players - 2000 champion {w|Sophie Gustafson} of Sweden, Germany's Caroline Massson, American {w|Angela Stanford}, and {w|Amy Yang} of South Korea. Defending champion and World Ranked Number 1 Yani Tseng of Taiwan was three shots back at one-under-par.Second round headlines belonged to the 22-year-old Caroline Masson, ranked 141st in the world. The native of Germany, who turned professional at the end of 2009 and plays on the Ladies European Tour, shot a bogey-free round of 65 to lead the championship after two rounds. Her total score of 11-under-par was the lowest halfway result in the event's history.Masson, who was tied for third after the first round, took advantage of the benign sunny conditions while playing in the last group on Friday. She went out in 32 making birdies at the 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th holes. On the par three 13th hole she added another birdie. On the 15th she went one shot better and almost eagled the par five 17th after hitting the green in two. During the post-round press conference she stated that one of the keys to her good score was work on a low ball flight, suitable for links courses. Masson's swing coach is G¨¹nter Kessler, who also works with her fellow countryman golfer {w|Martin Kaymer}.One shot behind Masson were two Korean players, overnight leader Meena Lee and {w|Inbee Park}. Lee, playing in a group preceding Masson's, could not repeat her Thursday performance and hit just five birdies and two bogeys for a round of 69.Park, on her way to a second place finish, shot the day's best round of 64, matched only by her compatriot and {w|World Golf Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Famer}, {w|2001 Women's British Open|2001 Women's British Open} champion {w|Se Ri Pak} who was tied for third place.Defending champion Yani Tseng made a jump up the leaderboard after posting a round of six-under. Tseng's total score of 137 gave her a 7th place position, four shots behind the leader.Of the 144 players who started the tournament, 68 made the cut which was set at +1. Notables not playing the weekend included Japan's {w|Ai Miyazato} and England's {w|Laura Davies}.On Saturday Masson continued to shine over the Carnoustie course. Her first hole, however, put a question mark on whether she would hold on to the leader's position. Her tee shot found the right rough and although she hit the green with her second, she three-putted for a bogey five. She quickly bounced back with a birdie on the second hole as she placed her approach shot within two metres from the pin. She followed with two consecutive birdies on the 5th and 6th holes, added another on the short 11th, and then birdied two remaining par fives 14th and 17th. She closed with a bogey on the last as her approach shot found the front right greenside bunker and she could not get up-and-down from there.Her playing partner, Inbee Park, struggled to repeat her Round 2 score and shot 73 to drop into a shared third position.The best round of the day belonged to the defending champion Yani Tseng as she shot 6-under 66 to climb into second place, two shots behind Masson. She carded five birdies, a solitary bogey on the 7th, and holed a 23-yard eagle putt on the 14th.The highest placed British player and a local favorite was the 2009 champion from {w|Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club|Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club}, {w|Catriona Matthew}. Her bogey-free round of 68 tied her for third.The start to the final round was the opposite of what followed later in the day. Both Masson and Tseng found the green with their second shots, but it was the Rolex Ranking number one, Tseng, who made the first mistake, three-putting for a bogey. Then the fortune reversed as the German struggled with her shots and the putter while Tseng made birdies.Masson's three-shot advantage after the first melted after another two holes ¨C she three-putted the 2nd and did not get up-and-down after missing the green on the 3rd, while Tseng made a birdie on the third hole. Tseng jumped into the lead after a birdie on the par five 6th, where her pitch onto the green left her with an easy putt. Masson then went on to bogey the 7th.Their scores did not change until the German bogeyed the 10th and 11th, and double-bogeyed the 12th, which essentially dropped her out of contention.Tseng, meanwhile, birdied the 11th to increase her lead over the rest of the field. Two dropped shots on the 12th and 13th, however, closed the gap to just two shots over the chasing Catriona Matthew, who was 11-under after nine holes. From then, there were no more mistakes for the leader as she birdied par fives 14th and 17th, and closed with a birdie at the 18th for a round of 16-under.For Tseng it was the second season in a row in which she has won two major championship titles; in June she won the LPGA Championship title.Catriona Matthew, despite being second at some point during the Sunday's round finished with a double bogey at the last. A total score of nine-under gave her a fifth place finish alongside Caroline Masson, who shot 78, including birdies at the last two holes.Runner-up place, four shots behind Tseng, was American {w|Brittany Lang} who shot a final round of 67.Best round of the day, 8-under 64, belonged to another native of the US, {w|Katie Futcher}. She made just a single birdie on the first nine, but then with five birdies and an eagle on the 14th, scored 29 going home, the lowest nine-hole result on LPGA Tour this season.Of the two amateurs who made it to the weekend, American {w|Danielle Kang} earned the honours of the best amateur player and received the Smyth Salver trophy given to the lowest-scoring non-professional.== Sources == 
[[British man survives artificial heart transplant]]A 40-year-old man from the United Kingdom has survived an operation in which he was given a wholly artificial heart. It is believed that this is the first time in the UK that a patient has been able to return home with such an implant.Matthew Green, a father of one, experienced the operation in {w|Papworth Hospital}, located in {w|Cambridgeshire}, England. His health has declined over the last few years, and he has suffered a substantial heart disorder, identified as {w|Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia|arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia}. He is waiting to have a human heart implanted. The disease would have claimed his life had the operation to implant a plastic heart not occurred. Approximately nine hundred operations of this nature have already taken place worldwide.Having survived the transplant, Green stated that the plastic heart will "revolutionise" his life. "Before I couldn't walk anywhere," commented Green. He described his ability "to be with normal people again" as "fantastic". Having the opportunity to live a relatively regular life "means the world" to Green.Providing a nine-and-a-half litre blood flow at its peak, the plastic heart can provide roughly twice that of a resting human body. The artificial heart was implanted last June in a six-hour operation. Unlike other mechanical hearts, Green's heart is powered by a pump that can be transported in a handheld bag.
[[Bill passed to raise US debt limit]]United States President Barack Obama on Tuesday signed into law a bill that raised the US debt limit, averting a predicted default on the government's bills, among other economic ramifications.The bill in question was the result of a deal announced by Obama on Sunday. It was approved by the House of Representatives on Monday night 269¨C161, passed the Senate early Tuesday afternoon 74¨C26, and was subsequently signed by Obama.Under the terms of the bill, the debt limit can be raised from its previous level of {w|US dollar|US$}14.3 trillion by $900 billion. An amount of $400 billion can be immediately authorized by the President, while the rest is still subject to Congressional approval. Along with the increase, there will be an immediate budget cut of $917 billion, with total savings of at least $2.1 trillion over the next decade.In the longer term, the bill allows the establishment of a special bipartisan committee of lawmakers from both the Senate and House to come up with proposals to reduce the federal budget deficit by at least another $1.5 trillion. Those proposals will be voted on no later than December 23, at which point the debt limit can be again increased, by up to $1.5 trillion if the committee's proposals are approved or by $1.2 trillion if they fail.
[[Swaziland to receive financial bailout from South Africa]]The small African nation of Swaziland will receive a financial {w|bailout} from neighbouring South Africa. The South African government agreed to a loan of 2.4 billion {w|South African rand|rand} after several organisations including the International Monetary Fund rejected King {w|Mswati III}'s request for a bailout. King Mswati III released a statement about the bailout saying, "We are thankful and also appreciate the assistance we have received from South Africa. This shows that they are good neighbours." He added "But it must be stressed that this is not a gift but a loan, which naturally should be repaid. This is why every Swazi must play his or her role by working hard wherever he is to ensure that the country gets back to its feet the soonest."The King has been criticized for living with 13 wives in luxury while the majority of his country lives in poverty.Despite the South African government's agreement, the bailout has been met with some concern. The opposition in South Africa said that the government should reject the loan as Swaziland is an "undemocratic state". However, the government has said that the bailout would bring stability to the state and surrounding region.The loan is expected to help Swaziland, which is going through a financial crisis.  The nation has reportedly been unable to pay some of its civil servants and could not afford {w|antiretroviral drug}s to treat HIV. Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Earlier this year, the country saw a wave of protests and demonstrations related to the economic situation.== Sources == 
[[Earl Anthony Wayne confirmed as U.S ambassador to Mexico]]The United States Senate has unanimously confirmed {w|Earl Anthony Wayne} as the new {w|United States Ambassador to Mexico|U.S ambassador} to Mexico. He replaces {w|Carlos Pascual}, who resigned in March following a dispute with {w|List of heads of state of Mexico|Mexican President} Felipe Calder¨®n.Wayne's nomination had been pending since June, and in late July the {w|United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee} approved the nomination. Before the confirmation he said ¡°One of my principal objectives...will be to work with my Mexican and U.S. colleagues to accelerate the implementation of the activities to assure that we are achieving our {w|M¨¦rida Initiative|M¨¦rida objectives}.¡±Wayne has previously served as the {w|United States Ambassador to Argentina|U.S ambassador} to Argentina and as the deputy ambassador to Afghanistan.Speaking about the Senate's choice of Wayne as a candidate for the ambassador's role, Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Mexico Institute of the {w|Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars} said ¡°They didn¡¯t want a controversial candidate. If you choose someone who is more of a political appointee than a career foreign service officer it can get caught up in the politics of the situation. [With Wayne] you¡¯re not picking someone out of the blue or somebody that the committee is not familiar with."== Sources == 
[[Russian geographer Andrey Kapitsa dies aged 80]]Kapitsa was born to Physics {w|Nobel Prize} laureate {w|Pyotr Kapitsa|Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa} in {w|Cambridge}, England in 1931.

[[Air France, pilots union, victims group criticise transatlantic disaster probe]]More than two years after {W|Air France Flight 447} crashed into the {w|Atlantic Ocean|foreign=suppress|Atlantic}, killing 228, a French pilots union, a group supporting victims' families, and {W|Air France} have all criticised the ongoing investigation. The {W|Bureau d'enqu¨ºtes et d'analyses} is being accused of trying to blame the pilots in order to absolve Airbus.The controversy follows the release of the BEA's latest interim report detailing findings so far. At the last moment, the BEA removed a recommendation added by chief investigator Alain Bouillard which called for alarms on {W|Airbus A330}s to be modified. The National Airline Pilots Union is concerned the investigation is degenerating "into a simple charge sheet against the crew," and says the latest revelations left them with "seriously damaged" faith in the investigators. The SNPL has withdrawn all support in the probe. Air France claim alarms on the A330-200 were "misleading" and contributed to the disaster. Robert Soulas, president of French victims' families group Entraide et Solidarit¨¦ AF447, claims the move proves bias in the BEA.The dispute surrounds stall warning systems. An aircraft {W|Aerodynamic stall|stalls} if it no longer has sufficient speed to keep itself airbourne. The warnings cut out at extremely low speeds, meaning if a stall progresses far enough the warning can cease. The correct course of action in a stall is to lower the nose, increasing an aircraft's speed; if the speed increases, the warnings can sound again. This may confuse pilots into abandoning corrective measures.The BEA have responded that the last-minute call to remove a recommendation calling for changes to stall warning design was owing to a need to examine the issue further. They say behavioral psychologists and cockpit designers have been teamed up to look into the warnings and how crews respond to them. The BEA intends to make a recommendation on the issue in the future, and a spokesperson expressed "deep regret" at the SNPL's response.Friday's 117-page report did examine the actions and training of the pilots. The report says they were untrained in high-altitude manual flying and in how to identify and react to failures of speed sensors. Neither was a standard part of training at the time. The {W|Pitot-static system|speed sensing system} failed, causing the autopilot and {W|autothrust} to switch off. This was followed by stall warnings, which the interim BEA report say were ignored by pilots during a three-and-a-half minute fall of 38,000 feet into the ocean."The haste with which these authorities and these officials accused the pilots without any forethought aroused our suspicions," said Soulas. "We now have confirmation that the affirmations coming from the BEA were not only premature, lacking any objectivity, partial and very oriented towards the defence of Airbus." For weeks his organisation has mounted protests against the direction taken by the investigation.Air France, who are battling legally with Airbus over responsibility, wrote to the {W|European Aviation Safety Agency} asking that they examine the stall warnings and seek that they be changed in need be. Air France previously upgraded the speed sensors on their A330s.Junior Transport Minister {w|Thierry Mariani} defended the BEA. "There has never been such a transparent enquiry: it was filmed, took place under the judiciary's control, with Brazilian [and] American investigators. These controversies discredit an enquiry that is exemplary." Airbus also responded. "Can you imagine for an instant that, because of economic interests or links between the BEA and Airbus, we'd put in peril all the other airlines operating this plane? It's neither conceivable nor admissible," said a statement. About 180 airlines use the Airbus A330. == Sources == 
[[Sitcom star Roseanne Barr announces run for U.S. president]]Barr, 58, starred as the blue collar, wise-cracking mother Roseanne Conner on Roseanne from 1988 to 1997. She made national headlines in 1990 for a shrill performance of the {w|The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem} at a {w|San Diego Padres} baseball game that then-President {w|George H.W.

After the conclusion of Roseanne, she hosted a {w|The Roseanne Show|short-lived talk show} from 1998 to 2000, before returning to her roots as a stand-up comedienne in the {w|HBO} special Roseanne Barr: Blonde N Bitchin'. Last month, Barr premiered in a new reality show on {w|Lifetime|Lifetime} called {w|Roseanne's Nuts}, which follows her life as a {w|Macadamia|macadamia nut} farmer in Hawaii. Two weeks ago, the show was watched by 1.6 million viewers, though last week only 785,000 tuned in. In an interview with {w|Fort Worth Star-Telegram|The Star-Telegram}, she admitted that the show serves as a launching pad for her presidential ambitions, arguing "I have to do a reality show in order to run for president of these United States", in allusion to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin's reality series {w|Sarah Palin's Alaska}.During her appearance on the Tonight Show, Barr insisted that she was serious and commented that Palin's potential candidacy is "kinda what got me to thinking that I too should run for president, if she can". Barr revealed that she had created her own political party, referred to as the "Green Tea Party", which combines elements of the {w|Green politics|Green} and Tea Party movements.

Juno will engage in an analysis of the planet from an orbit around it.Researchers hope that the spacecraft and its myriad of instruments will shed light on the origins of Jupiter.  Furthermore, being the largest and oldest planet in the solar system, scientists believe that Jupiter may also hold clues to the formation and evolution of the early solar system. Additionally, the data gathered from Juno may help scientists to understand early planetary processes occurring in other star systems beyond our own.Juno will travel roughly 1,740 million miles over the course of its five-year journey.== Sources == 
[[Bill to eliminate corruption does not go far enough, say Indian activists and lawyers]]A bill to eliminate corruption has been introduced into the lower house of India's parliament, but critics including lawyers and human rights activists are skeptical of the measures contained.The Draft {w|Lokpal Bill}, introduced into parliament on Thursday, seeks to establish an ombudsman, or Lokpal, to investigate wrongdoing by government and officials. It comes after decades of campaigning against government corruption and the hunger strike of anti-corruption activist {w|Anna Hazare} earlier this year.But the bill has been heavily criticized by Indian activists and lawyers who claim that it does not meet the needs of the people and will not free the country from corruption.The exemption of the prime minister and other members of parliament from being investigated will prevent it from working successfully, they argue. "There is no substance in the discussion that the prime minister should be out of the Lokpal Bill," a judge on the {W|Indian Supreme Court|Supreme Court} said on Wednesday, speaking outside his official capacity.Following his hunger strike in April, Hazare pushed Prime Minister {w|Manmohan Singh} to re-introduce the Lokpal Bill into Parliament. But he has condemned its current form calling it "a cruel joke." Hazare will again protest to have the draft bill revised and changed. "I will start my hunger strike from August sixteenth," he said.After meeting with lawyers of the {w|Allahabad High Court} Friday, members from {w|India Against Corruption}, a citizen's movement, said that the lawyers agreed that the introduced Lokpal Bill would not get rid of corruption in India. Mark Dummit, from The BBC, said that there is no guarantee that the bill will be passed. Past attempts have been denied by the upper house of Parliament since 1969.== Sources == 
[[United States Government loses AAA credit rating from Standard and Poor's]]The international credit ratings agency {w|Standard and Poor's} has confirmed that the United States {W|Obama administration|Government} has had its national credit rating downgraded one full notch from AAA to AA+ in the light of the recent drama concerning the US debt ceiling and the negotiations to have it raised before the August 2 deadline, citing concerns about budget deficits.In a statement, S&P said that the main reason for the downgrade was that the final deficit reduction bill passed by {W|US Congress|Congress} and the {W|US Senate|Senate} this Tuesday past were insufficient. The potential at this stage is for the downgrade to raise the cost of borrowing for the US Government in the future. It also stands to have a knock on effect for investor confidence, BBC correspondents claim. Losing its "Triple A" rating for the first time in history is a significant blow to President Barack Obama, leading a country with enormous debt, unemployment at over 9% and the possibility of another recession to follow.The {W|US Treasury} is thought to dispute the downgrade. "A judgment flawed by a $2tn error speaks for itself," an unnamed spokesman said, referring to errors anonymously-speaking officials claim to have identified in S&P's maths. China's national state-owned news org {W|Xinhua} said China has "every right now to demand the United States address its structural debt problems and ensure the safety of China's dollar assets." The US is more indebted to China than anyone else.There are no plans at this time for the other two major credit rating agencies, {w|Fitchs} and {w|Moody's}, to follow S&P's lead.== Sources ==

[[38 killed after US helicopter crashes in Afghanistan]]38 people were killed on Saturday when a US {w|Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook helicopter} crashed west of {w|Kabul}, Afghanistan, with the Taliban claiming responsibility for the crash.Thirty Americans were killed in the crash, including at least seventeen members of {w|SEAL Team 6}, Air Force members, the helicopter's crew, a dog handler and a civilian interpreter, while eight members of the Afghan Army were also on board and died.According to witnesses, members of the Taliban and officials from the US and Afghanistan, the Chinook was deliberately targeted, apparently  by a {w|rocket propelled grenade}.  While no American officials have spoken on the record about the cause of the crash, anonymous sources have said that the helicopter was shot down, an assertion that corresponds with reports from local officials and witness, who said that the helicopter crashed after a rocket struck it.The Taliban said that they had brought the aircraft down while it was involved in an operation targeting a house where insurgents were meeting.  While Taliban forces do not have a history of shooting down aircraft, they claim to have modified their RPGs for improved accuracy, but there is no proof of this.The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral {w|Mike Mullen}, warned against leaping to conclusions, however, saying that "[i]nformation is still coming in about this incident. I think it's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions."President Barack Obama issued a statement after the incident, saying that "[t]heir deaths are a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan."== Sources ==

[[Boeing rolls out first 787 Dreamliner to go into service]]Three years after it was first due for delivery, Boeing has rolled out the first {W|787 Dreamliner} that is to be delivered to a customer. Japan's {W|All Nippon Airways} were to take delivery in May 2008, but will now receive the aircraft next month.The plane promises increased fuel efficiency as it is the first model to be built out of plastic and carbon composites, more lightweight than conventional materials. Boeing says they have 800 orders at {W|US dollar|$}200 million per aircraft. Launch customer ANA have ordered 55.Delayed by Boeing's outsourcing system to a variety of subcontractors, two models have been developed. The 787-8 holds between 210 and 250 passengers; the 787-9 holds 250 to 290. Airlines choose the seating layout they want.After the 787, already bearing ANA's livery, arrives in {W|Tokyo} next month, the airline will use its first commercial flight for a special charter from Tokyo to {W|Hong Kong}. "We plan to use the 787 to expand our business, particularly our international routes," says ANA senior vice president Mitsuo Morimoto. "We plan to increase our revenue from international route significantly and the 787 will play an instrumental role in this," he adds, noting flights to Europe or the US are possibles for 787s."We are rolling out the first delivery airplane, the first 787," enthused Scott Fancher, 787 project manager and Boeing vice president. "That's an amazing thing for those who have worked on the program five, six, seven years, here at Boeing and our partners around the world."Boeing says they must increase the tempo of production from two a month to ten, if they are to meet customer demand.

[[Allied WWII spy Nancy Wake dies aged 98]]Born in New Zealand, she was raised in Australia but ran away when she was sixteen. By the 1930s she was a journalist in Paris when, in 1933, she took a trip to Austria to witness Nazi crimes against Jews. After interviewing {W|Adolf Hitler}, she chose to dedicate herself to being a thorn in his side. "In Vienna they had a big wheel and they had the Jews tied to it, and the stormtroopers were there, whipping them. When we were going out of Vienna they took our photos. That was my experience of Hitler," she later said.France surrendered to the Nazis in 1940, with Wake and her rich husband, businessman {W|Henri Fiocca}, joining the {W|French Resistance|Resistance of the German occupiers}. The duo helped fleeing soldiers and Jews in their journeys to Spain, with Wake's roles including spy, courier, and saboteur.Her husband convinced her to flee to the UK in 1943; upon arrival in England she joined {W|British Special Operations}. Wake and Fiocca never met again. The following year she parachuted back into France to give Resistance fighters a weapons delivery, but only found out after the nation's subsequent liberation that Fiocca had been captured by the Gestapo. They tortured and killed him through his defiance: he refused to give up his wife.The most decorated Australian servicewoman - and one of the most decorated among the Allies - Wake's honours included the {W|Legion D'Honneur}, the UK's {W|George Medal}, the US {W|Medal of Freedom}, and being made a {W|Companion of the Order of Australia}.Wake made her way back to Australia in 1949 and failed in repeated attempts to be elected to parliament. Since 1957 she has lived in England, married to ex-{W|Royal Air Force|UK Royal Air Force} pilot John Forward. She has been in a veterans' retirement home since 2003."Nancy Wake was a woman of exceptional courage and resourcefulness whose daring exploits saved the lives of hundreds of Allied personnel and helped bring the Nazi occupation of France to an end," Australian PM Julia Gillard said in tribute, calling her "a devastatingly effective saboteur and spy". {W|Warren Truss}, leader of the {W|Australian National Party}, called her exploits "the stuff of legend." "[A]ll Australians feel very proud of this wonderful woman," he said.New Zealand's Veterans' Affairs Minister {W|Judith Collins} shared the sentiment, calling Wake "a woman of exceptional courage and tenacity, who cast aside all regard for her own safety and put the cause of freedom first". Wake's stance on freedom was clear: "Freedom is the only thing worth living for," she said after the war. "While I was doing that work, I used to think it didn't matter if I died, because without freedom there was no point in living."Her story inspired {W|Charlotte Gray|Charlotte Gray} by author {W|Sebastian Faulks}, later made into {W|Charlotte Gray|the movie of the same name}.

However, his polling numbers have remained low. For inclusion in the debate, Karger cites an August 4 Harris poll that shows him with two percent support, an April 28 Fox News poll and Zogby polls from May 23 and July 25 that show one percent support, combined with a June 29 McClathy-Marist poll that includes Karger with less than one percent support for an overall average of one percent in five polls. Fox News' vice president of news Michael Clemente disputes this finding and remarked to the Des Moines Register that the April 28 poll cited was no longer considered recent and that the polls used were not sufficient to fulfill the requirements. In response, Karger tweeted "I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it any more...We will not be treated differently any more." He claims that Fox News did not specify which polls could not be included in the criteria. He opened a website titled "Let Fred In!" and supporters have started a petition to Fox News. The filing deadline for the debate is scheduled to end today at 4 p.m. {w|Central Time Zone|CDT}.  If Karger is not included, he plans to file a complaint with the {w|Federal Election Commission}.

BMW reported that 129,094 units were sold during the month, consisting of the motor vehicle brands of BMW, {w|Mini} and {w|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}.In a statement, Ian Robertson, member of the Board of Management of BMW, told of the company reporting "the most successful July sales ever", claiming that it is "well on [the] way to achieving our recently announced target of over 1.6 million vehicles in 2011, the best ever sales result for the BMW group".Demand increases were notable in the United States and China in particular. 21,409 vehicles were delivered by BMW in the United States in July, an increase of 11.7 per cent from July 2010. In China, 18,858 units were sold in the month, meaning a sales rise of 36.1 per cent on the same month last year, with the increased popularity being attributed to "substantial gains in many markets", BMW said. Sales increases were also reported in South Korea, Russia, India and Brazil. BMW did admit to a decrease of sales by 0.8% in Germany, the country in which the company is based. {QuoteLeft|[BMW has had] the most successful July sales ever|source=Ian Robertson, BMW Board of Management member}As a brand, BMW sales stood at 108,721 for July, 7.1% more than July 2010.

[[Rioting develops throughout England]]Rioting, theft, vandalism and other acts of violence are currently occurring in various cities throughout England. There is a substantial rioting problem, primarily in the capital of London, which has spread to the cities of Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and {w|Nottingham}.David Cameron, the current UK {w|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister}, condemned the violent acts, referring to them as "sickening", proclaiming that those involving themselves the incident "will feel the full force of the law". At least 563 individuals have been arrested in relation to these incidents. He also reported that Parliament is to be recalled this Thursday. The number of police officers in London tonight is to be increased from six thousand to sixteen thousand, the Prime Minister said, with any pre-arranged leave being abandoned.The riots were sparked by the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan on Thursday in Tottenham, during the planned arrest of Duggan as part of anti-gun unit Operation Trident. Reports from the {W|Independent Police Complaints Commission} claimed that Duggan had been shot in retaliation, however the IPCC later admitted there is no evidence that Duggan shot at the police. On Sunday, a peaceful protest in Tottenham held by Duggan's family and friends sparked a series of disturbances in the area, which quickly became a violent riot, with youths from the area looting and clashing with Police.For three consecutive days, London has experienced what the {w|Metropolitan Police} have referred to as "copycat criminal activity". Hundreds of arrests have now occurred, with 105 individuals having been charged for a variety of crimes. The Metropolitan Police are now contemplating the concept of using plastic bullets as a disciplinary method within the riots.

[[DNA components found in meteorites]]A recently published study in the {w|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America} indicates that the essential building blocks for early life on Earth may have indeed been delivered through extraterrestrial material such as {w|meteorite|meteorites}. These molecules, known as {w|nucleobase|nucleobases}, are key components of {w|Deoxyribose nucleic acid|DNA} and have been found in meteorites several times before.However, until now, scientists could never be certain that these compounds were native to the meteorites or if they were simply contamination from the terrestrial environment in which they landed. To this end, researchers analyzed eleven different organic-rich meteorites, called {w|carbonaceous chondrite|carbonaceous chondrites}, for the presence of nucleobases and found that three of these molecules are very rare on Earth.Additionally, none of these nucleobases were found in the soil or ice in close proximity to where the meteorites were found. This led the researchers to conclude that it was likely that these molecules were extraterrestrial in origin which could mean that life on Earth may have originally been seeded by such material.== Sources == 
[[Scottish annual drug deaths coming down from record levels]]New figures from the Registrar General for Scotland show 2010 saw 485 drug-linked deaths, down 11% from 545 in 2009. Although the third-highest number recorded, the highest and second-highest levels were in 2008 and 2009 respectively. 2008's record was 574 deaths.Over 50% of drug-connected deaths last year involved {W|heroin} or {W|morphine}. 174 were linked to heroin substitute {W|methadone}, {W|benzodiazepines} to 154, alcohol to 127, {W|cocaine} to 33 and {W|amphetamines} to three. Nobody was killed by {W|ecstacy}. One in four involved a woman, with 33% of the dead aged between 25 and 34."These figures represent 485 lives lost to families and communities across Scotland and while I welcome the news of a further decrease, any death is one too many," according to Community Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham. The Scottish Government says the drop means efforts to curb drug fatalities are making progress, with the introduction of opiate poisoning remedy {W|naloxone} being credited.Naloxone kits and training are being given to communities and the the prison service. The government is spending {W|Pound sterling|?}28.6 million tackling drug use. Though the national levels have dropped, some areas have a different story. {W|Lanarkshire}, {W|Lothian}, and {W|Ayrshire and Arran} saw increased numbers. Scottish Drugs Forum director noted "If you look at the rate of drug-related deaths among the drug using population, Scotland has similar rates to our European neighbours. But if you look at the rate of drug-related deaths compared to the overall population, Scottish people are seven times more likely to die from a drug-related death than their European counterparts."Critics claim the figures should include deaths from {W|hepatitis C} contracted as a result of drug use.== Sources == 
[[Fiona Donnison jailed for murdering her children in UK]]Fiona Donnison, a mother of two, has been found guilty of killing her own children. The 45-year-old, from {w|Surrey}, England, had been accused of murdering her son Harry and daughter Elise, aged three and two years respectively.The murders occurred in January 2010, with the bodies of Harry and Elise Donnison found in bags in their mother's car, close to the family's former residence in {w|East Sussex}. Fiona Donnison is thought to have then awaited the arrival of Paul Donnison, her former partner, with two knives to injure him. Mr Donnison failed to appear at the scene; he was residing with a new girlfriend at the time.On January 27 of this year, Fiona Donnison entered a police station in the town of {w|Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield} and confessed to murdering the children but did not inform police of the location of their bodies. When the {w|Nissan} vehicle was searched, the bodies of Elise and Harry were discovered in two separate holdalls.In {w|Lewes Crown Court}, where the trial was held, the prosecution described Donnison suffocating the children to death and placing their bodies inside a vehicle. Donnison herself did not give evidence at trial.The defence for Donnison claimed that she had been suffering from severe depression and was not in the correct state of mind at the time of the incident, saying that the offences should be downgraded to manslaughter. The defence claimed she was unable to recall the incident and was not able to bring herself to identify the two children by name.A clinical psychologist contested that statement, deeming such mental health difficulties impossible in this case. It was "100% likely [she was] feigning" them, they said. The prosecution attributed their claims to the preparation involved in the committing of the crime. This, it said, was justification for the murder charge.The jury at Lewes Crown Court unanimously found Fiona Donnison guilty of the two murders. As the verdict was delivered, the accused opted to remain in her cell. She was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum period in custody of 32 years. The judge, Mr Justice Nicol, believed that their deaths were "no accident". He remarked: "You killed them, you who were their mother. Why you did this defies logical explanation. It seems it can only have something to do with your feelings for Paul Donnison, the children's father and your former partner."Outside the court, Paul Donnison commented that his family had suffered an "almost unbearable" experience. Paul also claimed that the system for bringing criminals to justice was "biased" towards the accused, commenting on how Fiona had been handled "with kid gloves".With the sentence having been given out, it has emerged that prosecutors were intending to have Ms. Donnison tried for a third murder charge. This would have been for Mia, the first child Fiona had with Paul. Mia died at the age of nine months in April 2004, originally thought to be down to {w|Sudden infant death syndrome|sudden infant death syndrome}. In a hearing before the trial, the prosecuting side claimed they had "taken together" enough evidence for a murder charge to be taken in contemplation in Mia's case. Mr Justice Cooke decided against this charge being brought on as part of the court trial, citing the absence of direct evidence about the death of Mia.== Sources == 
[[Fiona Donnison jailed for murdering children]]Regarding the shooting of Mark Duggan there are still many unanswered questions. However we do known that the firearms officers did not explicitly claim they were shot at but claimed their lives were threatened. We know that a loaded gun was at the scene. we know that at this stage there is no evidence the pistol at the scene was fired. This leaves the very real possibility that the gun was still being used in a threatening manner - Firearms officers are not obliged to wait until they are shot upon in order for themselves to open fire. The IPCC are, as the name suggests, and independent entity from the police. The tone of this article is tending towards an attempt to cover something up for the police - use of the word "admitted" suggests an attempt to initially conceal the information which seems unnecessarily inflammatory to me.I also take issue with the way the shooting is described as sparking the riots in this articles and indeed in other reports in the mainstream media. I would argue that the shooting sparked a riot in Tottenham on saturday. It is this riot that then set precedent for other riots to take place. By wording it this way I think that the subsequent riots seen this week are more suitably distanced from the shooting of Mark Duggan, which most people seem to aggree but some of the media seem slow to pick up on.
[[Former Ukrainian PM Yulia Tymoshenko arrested on contempt of court charges]]On Monday, Judge Rodion Kireyev declined the second request to release {w|Yulia Tymoshenko|Yulia V. Tymoshenko}, who was jailed last Friday for contempt of court. Tymoshenko faces trial in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, facing charges of abuse of office and exceeding her power as Prime Minister.Prosecutors charged Tymoshenko in May 2011 for overstepping her powers by signing a gas deal with Russia in January 2009. Investigators believed the gas price agreement was too high and caused the Ukrainian economy to lose at least {w|United States dollar|US$}182 million. As a result of these initial charges she was placed under travel restrictions.As the trial began, Tymoshenko was accused of repeatedly violating court rules and proceedings. The judge ordered her arrest for contempt after she reportedly refused to stand up whilst addressing the judge. The prosecution accused Tymoshenko of mocking witnesses openly questioning Judge Rodion Kireyev¡¯s objectivity. Tymoshenko denies these charges and believing the trial is merely political. Tymoshenko¡¯s lawyer Sergei Vlasenko describes her detention as "unprecedented and illegal."Many have appealed for her release, including her lawyers, 200 prominent Ukrainians who signed a petition, leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Patriarch Filaret, and Foreign Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk. Both Tymoshenko and her supporters believe this trial is politically motivated with ties to {w|Viktor Yanukovych|President Viktor Yanukovych}, suspected of attempting to bar her from future elections. The trial has attracted the attention of both the US and EU, who have criticised the charges, saying selective prosecution of political opponents is evident. However, the Ukrainian government denies any involvement.Outside the court, protestors have been occupying Kiev¡¯s main streets, setting up tents and waiving the white and red flags of Tymoshenko¡¯s political party. The support for her release is overwhelming, despite a ban on rallies passed by city court. Protestors are being watched closely by dozens of Berkut anti-riot police. If sentenced, Tymoshenko may face up to ten years in prison. The trial is expected to continue next Monday.== Sources == 
[[Three killed amongst Birmingham, England riots]]A car fatally crashed into three individuals in the British city of Birmingham, England. The three men, aged 31, 30, and 21, died during a second consecutive night of violent events in Birmingham.The incident occurred at approximately 0100 {w|British Summer Time|BST} Wednesday morning in the Birmingham inner-city region of {w|Winson Green}. The men were attempting to protect property from nearby riots. Witness reports say that the vehicle contained as many as three passengers and drove at a speed of fifty miles per hour without stopping after the crash.Police have since recovered a vehicle and arrested a 32-year-old male in association with the incident, on a charge of murder. According to Chief Constable Chris Sims, the details of the incident {w|West Midlands Police} have would indicate that "the car was deliberately driven". Tariq Jahan, the father of one of those killed, said his son, 21-year-old Haroon Jahan, was attempting to protect the area from nearby violence and unrest. Jahan said he had attempted to perform CPR at the scene of the incident. Jahan said his son was "a very good lad, a good man starting at the beginning of his life and had his whole life ahead of him. I've got no words to describe why he was taken and why this has happened and what's happening to the whole of England." Jahan said violent acts like this which killed innocent bystanders made "no sense". {QuoteLeft|[There is] simply no excuse whatsoever for the violence, looting and destruction|source={{w|Nick Clegg}, British {w|Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister}}}A statement released from {w|West Midlands Police} says that "detectives are treating [this incident] as murder. Three men were taken to hospital where two later died from their injuries. A third man was in a critical condition but confirmed dead at around 6:30AM. West Midlands Police have launched a murder inquiry, arrested one man in connection with the incident and recovered a vehicle nearby which will be examined by forensics experts," the force stated. Police have requested that individuals contact them if they have any information about the incident. About 200 people from the Asian community have gathered at the hospital where the victims were transported after the crash. Two of the victims were known to be brothers. All three of them were reported to be Pakistani Muslims.The {w|West Midlands} has seen other instances of violent behavior. Thefts have taken place in the city centre of Birmingham, {w|West Bromwich} and in {w|Wolverhampton}. The charges being brought against suspects on remand for court appearances include public disorder offences, such as violent disorder and aggravated burglary. Six police officers have experienced minor injuries as a result of the violence.According to police, a scrapyard fire which occurred in Birmingham is unrelated to recent violence. Two ambulances were attacked in two separate incidents with objects being thrown at the vehicles. Ambulance staff were left uninjured in both cases. Ambulances have appeared on thirty-five occassions in West Bromwich, Wolverhampton and various parts of Birmingham. Thirty-one individuals were given ambulance staff treatment, with nineteen receiving hospital treatment, albeit for practically minor assaults in most cases.In Wolverhampton and West Bromwich, there have been reports of roads and streets being closed. Wolverhampton and Birmingham have experienced significant travel disruption, with buses not entering city centres last night. One vehicle in Birmingham and two in West Bromwich have been set alight amongst the violence. Various businesses have also been targeted, such as {w|Marks & Spencer|M&S} and a high fidelity shop in Birmingham. A jewelry business in Wolverhampton has been robbed of ornaments, watches and money.Yesterday, British {w|Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister} Nick Clegg condemned the violent actions of individuals, claiming there was "simply no excuse whatsoever for the violence, looting and destruction".

[[Riots in England continue for a fourth night]]Rioting continued to spread throughout England last night, with reports of violence in Manchester. Birmingham, Liverpool and {w|Nottingham} also suffered a second night of disorder, with three confirmed fatalities in Birmingham. In the capital, the extra ten thousand police brought into the city on Tuesday kept the city relatively under control, with no major violence reported.A {w|Miss Selfridge} shop in Manchester was set ablaze as gangs of rioters looted from and trashed shops in the city center. In Nottingham, police arrested over 90 people during incidents that included attacks on three police stations with petrol bombs.In Birmingham, arrests were made as gangs attempted to break into shopping centers. In the early hours it was reported that shots had been fired upon police, and that three British Asian men had been killed in a hit-and-run attack whilst protecting their business from looting.Prime Minister David Cameron has authorised the use of water cannons to control the riots, at 24 hours notice, and has reiterated the fact that police have legal authority to employ baton-rounds if required. However, Sir Hugh Orde, the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has ruled out the deployment of water cannons for the foreseeable future, as "these are fast-moving crowds, where water cannon would not be appropriate."Meanwhile, a community-organized cleanup operation has been mobilised through social media websites like Facebook and Twitter.
[[Finnish police to receive guidance on Internet 'hate speech']]Police in Finland are collecting together online comments to show to the Office of the Prosecutor General. His deputy says legal guidance is to be given on when Internet postings qualify as illegal "hate speech".Deputy Prosecutor General Jorma Kalske says plans are afoot to present proposed guidelines on what is and is not accepted in an online context within months, and to consider heavier punishement upon repeat offenders. Current violators of the nation's hate speech law face fines or up to two years in prison, although there has never been a jailing."The goal is to deal with those possibly problematic debates the police encounters" on the Internet, says Kalske, noting there is a "relatively substantial" quantity to deal with. He claims comments some politicians had made on immigration constitute "incitement against a population or ethnic group or religion;" immigration-debate remarks are among the material police are sending for consideration."The amount of hate speech has increased to such an extent that it¡¯s time to consider together rather closely what the law says on this and clarify at what stage internet writings need to come into the purview of criminal law, when it¡¯s a question of a fine, when of imprisonment and so on," he says. The crux of the matter is "drawing a line between voicing political opinions, expressing freedom of speech and what is called in colloquial language hate speech," he told {W|Agence France-Presse}.== Sources == 
[[Texas governor Rick Perry to announce his presidential intentions]]According to aides, longtime Texas {w|Governor of Texas|Governor} {w|Rick Perry} will announce his intentions to run for {w|President of United States} this Saturday in South Carolina after a tour of three early {w|Republican Party|Republican} primary and caucus states. His announcement will follow Saturday's nonbinding {w|Ames Straw Poll} in Iowa, for which he is not on the ballot. Perry has served as Governor of Texas since late 2000 when former President George W. Bush stepped down from the office after his victory in the {w|United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election}. Perry won election as governor in his own right in {w|Texas gubernatorial election, 2002|2002} and was re-elected in {w|Texas gubernatorial election, 2006|2006}. After a primary challenge from U.S. Senator and fellow Republican {w|Kay Bailey Hutchison}, Perry was elected to an unprecedented third term in {w|Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|2010}. His executive experience and record of job-creation has been hailed by supporters, though he has been criticized for his cuts to education and 2009 suggestion that Texas could lawfully {w|Secession in the United States|secede from the Union}.Speculation about a potential run heightened after Perry organized and attended a Christian prayer gathering in Houston last week, which was seen as outreach to the {w|Christian right|religious right}.  Perry has support from members of the populist Tea Party movement, and is known for his call for {w|states' rights}, which he outlined in his 2010 book Fed Up.  His position on states' rights has caused concerns for some social conservatives such as presidential candidate {w|Rick Santorum}, who criticized Perry after his  comments that the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York was "their business, and that¡¯s fine with me". Perry later clarified that he was referring to "state sovereignty" and that he personally opposes same-sex marriage.Perry will join a growing list of Republican candidates for the presidency that includes former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, Representative {w|Michele Bachmann} of Minnesota, businessman {w|Herman Cain} of Georgia and fellow Texan Republican Rep. Ron Paul. Romney, the current frontrunner for the nomination seems vulnerable to political analysts. Commentator {w|John Fund} described him as "weak" and {w|Stuart Rothenberg} of the Rothenberg Political Report found that while Romney is favored by the party establishment, Perry will likely find more support among the party base, "In terms of ideology, style, priorities and geographical appeal, Perry and Romney are very different candidates, and they appeal to very different constituents."Blogger {w|Erick Erickson} of {w|RedState}, who will headline the website's gathering where Perry is expected to make his announcement, commented "the race is shaping up as who can beat Barack Obama and who is the best alternative to Mitt Romney. And none of the candidates so far has been able to consolidate those two goals like I think Perry will try to do."== Sources == 
[[School Principal found dead in Tennessee classroom; teen held by police]]Police authorities say the body of Suzette York, 49, was found shortly after 11am on Wednesday morning in a classroom at Memphis Junior Academy in {w|Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis}, Tennessee, United States.

[[Renewed concern over nuclear response following atomic bomb anniversary]]As Japan last weekend marked the 66th anniversary of the atomic bombings of {w|Hiroshima} and {w|Nagasaki}, concern continues to mount about new revelations of elevated radiation readings following the March 11 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.Evidence of unsafe levels of radiation within the food supply chain continues to emerge, with Japanese media reporting on Wednesday that a Greenpeace study has found radioactivity exceeding government-mandated levels in four out of eight fish samples taken from the Fukushima Prefecture.The news comes as media reports of recent weeks have highlighted spikes in radiation readings at the crippled plant. On August 3, plant operator {w|Tokyo Electric Power Company} reported potentially deadly levels of radiation in the damaged reactors, including one reading of 10 sieverts per hour. Such levels are enough to kill a person ¡°within a few weeks¡±, according to the {w|World Nuclear Association}, and are 250 times the readings recorded immediately after the disaster.The radiation findings have further called into question the response of government and industry to the crisis, with renewed allegations of incompetence and dishonesty being levelled against Japanese authorities over the transparency of information released in the months following the disaster. TEPCO only conceded that ¡°partial meltdowns¡± had occurred in up to three of the Fukushima site¡¯s reactors last month.In testimony to Japanese parliament in late July, Professor Tatsuhiko Kodama, head of the Radioisotope Centre at the {w|University of Tokyo}, condemned the government's response to the catastrophe. His criticism centered on inadequate radiation measurement methods and the failure to properly protect communities potentially affected by radioactivity from the stricken plant, citing the example of school bus routes passing through areas, such as Iitate-Mura, with unsafe levels of radiation.Kodama says the ¡°{w|uranium} equivalent¡± of the radiation from Fukushima amounts to ¡°20 Hiroshima bombs¡±, while the natural decrease in radioactivity caused by the disaster is far slower than that caused by an atomic bomb: one-tenth against one-thousandth of original levels after a year.¡°We should recognize from the start that just like {w|Chernobyl}, Fukushima I Nuclear Plant has released radioactive materials equivalent in the amount to tens of nuclear bombs,¡± he said during his parliamentary testimony. ¡°The resulting contamination is far worse than the contamination by a nuclear bomb.¡±Further criticism was levelled against authorities this week when {w|The New York Times} revealed that shortly after the initial disaster Tokyo bureaucrats had failed to warn evacuees in the Tsushima district that wind patterns were blowing radiation spewing from the Fukushima site towards them. Despite the recent revelations, the ongoing fallout from the catastrophe has largely slipped from the mainstream international news agenda. Australian online publication Crikey! last week denounced the poor airing of contamination and accountability issues in the Japanese press, claiming it has been left to bloggers and social media to accurately portray the still-unfolding crisis.It is in this context that unofficial citizen groups have begun conducting their own measurements of radiation levels at various sites around Japan. Yesterday, Al-Jazeera reported on one such group, called Safecast, whose US and Japanese investigators have discovered disturbing readings not identified by official government agencies. For instance, on August 7 the group uncovered ground readings of 20,000 counts per minute 28 kilometres from the stricken plant, well outside the government¡¯s 20-kilometre mandatory evacuation zone.¡°Getting into this has showed us there is a lack of data everywhere,¡± says Sean Bonner, the group¡¯s director.The Al-Jazeera report also quotes Jyunichi Tokuyama, a specialist with the Iwate Prefecture Agricultural and Fisheries Department, who said he was shocked to find radioactive hotspots up to 300 kilometres from Fukushima. "The biggest cause of this contamination is the rice straw being fed to the cows, which was highly radioactive," Tokuyama told Al Jazeera, reflecting fears about the effects of the disaster in terms of contaminated food supplies. In the wake of the ongoing crisis, the Japanese government has pledged to reduce the country¡¯s reliance on nuclear power, reflecting widespread public concern.== Sources ==

[[China sends its first aircraft carrier to sea]]The state-run Chinese news agency {w|Xinhua} reported yesterday that China had sent its first aircraft carrier to sea for a trial. This marks an important step forward in China's efforts to become a leading naval power and challenge US superiority in Asia. China will be joining a small group of nations with operational aircraft carriers ¡ª the United States, {w|Italian Navy|Italy}, the {w|Royal Navy|UK}, {w|French Navy|France}, {w|Royal Thai Navy|Thailand}, {w|Brazilian Navy|Brazil}, {w|Indian Navy|India}, {w|Russian Navy|Russia}, and {w|Spanish Navy|Spain} are the other nations have aircraft carriers in operation.The 1,000-foot carrier is based on the unfinished {w|Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag}, which China purchased in 2001, and is designed to carry approximately 2,000 people and 50 fighter jets. It cannot yet be defined as fully operational, since while it has a new engine, radar, guns and other equipment, it does not have enough combat power to pose a serious threat without the support of other ships. BBC reporter Michael Bristow estimates that it will be a few years before the vessel is fully operational. According to Chinese officials, the carrier will mainly be used for training crew and fighter pilots who need training to take off and land in the limited space of aircraft carriers.China has said that it is not attempting to challenge the US navy, which has 11 aircraft carriers in operation ¡ª 10 of which are nuclear-powered {w|Nimitz class aircraft carrier|Nimitz class aircraft carriers} that can carry 6,250 people. However, the ship is still viewed by Chinese people as a powerful symbol of the growing strength of the Chinese navy which, according to some analysis, may catch up with the US in a few decades.== Sources ==

[[Scientists use gene therapy, patients' own immune systems to fight leukemia]]Researchers at the {w|University of Pennsylvania} have developed a new treatment for a type of {w|leukemia} that uses a patient's own immune system to fight cancer cells. Scientists extracted the blood from three male patients, all of whom suffered from advanced leukemia. They inserted a gene into the patients' {w|T-cells}, and the gene reprograms the cells to actively seek out and kill cancer cells within the blood. They then returned the modified blood to the patients.The patients initially reported symptoms similar to those of a bad case of the flu, but the researchers pointed out that this was likely due to the body's response to rapid cancer cell death all at once. However, once the symptoms subsided, the scientists found that two of the three patients had no signs of leukemia and the third, while still sick, showed significant improvement. Additionally, they discovered that the modified T-cells not only killed existing cancer cells, but brand new ones as well.Though optimistic, experts say that more research needs to be done to determine if this will be a viable treatment on a large scale and warn that this therapy would not be available as an approved treatment for several more years. == Sources ==

[[Phone hacking scandal prompts media review in Australia]]Top Australian government politicians will attempt to launch an official media regulation enquiry, following public calls for a better understanding of the relationship between the media and politicians. Concerns regarding the behaviour of the Australian media follow the exposure of the News of the World tabloid newspaper following the phone hacking of public figures. Rupert Murdoch, owner of British tabloid {w|News of the World} before it was shut down, currently owns more than half of the nation's press through {w|News Corporation|News Corporation's} Australian subsidiary, News Limited. News Limited recently announced they would review their expenses to ensure no payments had been made in an unethical manner. A recent Newsstand poll found 70 percent of Australians agreed that ¡°too few people control the media¡± within the country. However, Senator {w|Bob Brown} has acknowledged making any changes to media ownership in the country may be impossible. ¡°We don¡¯t have the anti-monopoly laws that the United States has, but no harm in looking at it and what impact that has," he said.Australian media outlets were recently accused of holding biased agendas towards the government following the phone hacking scandal. Federal Communications Minister {w|Stephen Conroy} accused News Limited tabloid, "The Daily Telegraph", of staging a public campaign calling for a ¡°regime change¡± in government. Prime Minister Julia Gillard held frank discussions with News Limited editors late last month. Ms. Gillard refused to reveal what was discussed in the closed-door meeting, but stated it was a ¡°broad ranging discussion¡­canvassing a number of topics".  The meeting followed her statement that ¡°hard questions¡± needed to be answered by the media company. The Australian public has welcomed the call to investigate media giants, with a Newsstand petition calling for an examination into the standards of reporting, privacy measures, the diversity of the media and regulations regarding the handling of problems and complaints. However, maintaining the freedom of the press is still of high concern. Senator Brown believes the calls for media inquiry were a ¡°decent response¡± in light of the News of the World exposure. Negotiations for a full enquiry into the Australian media will resume when Parliament recommences next week. There is no evidence of any unethical behaviour within the Australian media at present. == Sources ==

[[Texas continues to suffer record-breaking drought]]Experts state that the lengthy drought conditions seen all over Texas this summer will effect the state's economy and ecosystems for years.  Climatologist John Nielson-Gammon told reporters that July was the hottest month ever on record in the state and that the 12-month period ending July 31st represented the worst drought year in Texas in at least 116 years. He was also quoted as saying that Texas has entered a "vicious cycle" where drought and heat aggravate each other. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 94 percent of Texas is suffering either extreme or exceptional drought. Travis Miller, professor of soil and crop sciences at Texas A&M University, has estimated that this year farmers and ranchers in the state will lose $8 billion, "the largest agriculture loss we have ever experienced." Miller also suggested that the worse outcomes may not even be here yet.  "Climatic models show there is another La Nina system, which is blamed for this drought, coming our way this fall," Miller said. "That is not a good thing."Tom McAlley, a rancher in {w|Tatum, Texas|Tatum}, stated, "It's a big problem. People don't understand¡ªthis drought effects domestic and wild animals, the economy, everything." Texas ranchers complain of feeding their cattle this summer, which is extremely rare as cattle normally consume natural grasses and vegetation during summer months. Tim Jenkins, a rancher near {w|Athens, Texas|Athens}, stated during an interview, "I have three ponds on my [ranch] ¡ª they're all dry now. They should be teeming with frogs, insects. Small animals would normally go there to drink. I've got hundreds of dead fish in those ponds. I've paid huge sums of money just to feed my cattle this summer. If my parents were alive, they wouldn't believe what we're going through right now. I may see the effects of this for the remainder of my life."== Sources == 
[[Japan to use renewable energy]]A new law which seeks to utilise reusable energy and minimise cost impact on consumers is under development in Japan. The new law, which would be effective from July 1 next year, would seek to reduce Japan's dependency on nuclear power.The new legislation would urge power utilities to cut costs by purchasing renewable energy from outside companies and private businesses. Japan's decision has been referred to as opening the door on renewable energy, which currently only contributes to six percent of Japan's energy sources.Politicians have amended the bill, allowing the revised bill to pass through parliament later this month. Prime Minister {w|Naoto Kan} who is pushing for the bill to be passed in return for his resignation, has stated that the 'feed-in-tariff on renewable energy will be set at a fixed price so that utilities are limited to purchasing electricity from renewable power generators. Kan hopes that this will encourage more business and private corporate partners to enter into the renewable energy market."As a medium-term revolutionary energy and environmental strategy, we have decided to start a thorough review of nuclear power policy and draw a roadmap for a reduction of the dependence on nuclear power" Mr Kan said.Large companies are concerned about the new legislation as it will continue to affect profit margins which are low due to power shortages and high priced exports. The bill was changed to reduce the surcharge for large power companies after complaints from the Japanese steel industry. If the scheme is launched then consumers will face an increase on electricity bills as utilities can pass their costs onto end-users. Despite the governments promise to cap the surcharge for the next ten years, there is no reference to it in the revised bill. Lawmakers hope that by adding a provision requiring utilities to streamline their operations, the impact on consumers will be minimized.A third party group will be set up within the under the Agency for National Resources and Energy to ensure that the setting of fixed prices are fair and just.

She was arrested in March this year. Wang pleaded not guilty, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail if convicted.A large group of police watched over supporters and other activists who had gathered outside the court.The case is the latest in what many believe is a crackdown by the Chinese government on dissenters. The use of online blogging by dissenters, supporters say, concerns the authorities as it allows information to be spread quickly and may lead to public unrest.Foreign and Chinese journalists were not allowed to enter the courtroom to hear the case.One of Wang's lawyers, Han Yicun, said it was an unfair trial. "I was interrupted many times, the judge did not allow me to talk, no matter how I tried to explain," he said.

The new drug, known as {w|DRACO|DRACO}, is able to discriminate between healthy cells and those infected by viruses. It essentially signals the infected cells to die, preventing the virus from replicating and moving into other cells, all while leaving adjacent healthy cells completely unaffected. Furthermore, scientists believe that it would be difficult for viruses to develop a {w|Drug resistance|resistance} to this kind of treatment.The researchers involved in the project have already tested this drug on mice who have been infected with lethal amounts of influenza and found that the mice were completely cured as a result. They hope to test this drug against several other types of viruses in mice before moving on to human trials in the future.== Sources == 
[[Texas governor Rick Perry enters presidential race]]Texas {w|Governor of Texas|Governor} {w|Rick Perry} officially announced Saturday that he is running for {w|President of the United States} as a {w|Republican Party|Republican}. In a speech before the {w|RedState} convention in South Carolina, Perry said "It is time to get America working again. That's why with the support of my family and an unwavering belief in the goodness of America, I declare to you today my candidacy for president of the United States."The announcement, which coincides with the nonbinding {w|Ames Straw Poll} in Iowa, follows months of media speculation and reports from earlier in the week that Perry planned to enter the race Saturday. Other candidates include former Massachusetts {w|Governor of Massachusetts|governor} Mitt Romney, Representative {w|Michele Bachmann} of Minnesota, businessman {w|Herman Cain} of Georgia and Representative Ron Paul of Texas. Early polls place Perry in second place, just behind Romney, who analysts consider a "weak" frontrunner for the nomination.Perry, 61, has served as Governor of Texas since late 2000 when former President George W. Bush stepped down following his election as president. Two years later, Perry was {w|Texas gubernatorial election, 2002|elected governor} in his own right, and was re-elected twice in {w|Texas gubernatorial election, 2006|2006}, and in {w|Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|2010}  following a primary battle with Senator {w|Kay Bailey Hutchison}. He has never lost a political election.Perry is expected to run as an outsider to Washington politics, though, he is likely to be compared to former President George W. Bush, who served as governor of Texas before becoming president. However, in recent years, Perry has been increasingly critical of the spending policies under Bush, and relations between their aides have been strained. Nonetheless, Perry has reserved most of his political criticism for President Barack Obama. In allusion to Obama, Perry commented Saturday that "Page one of any economic plan to get American working is to give a pink slip to the current residents in the White House." As president, Perry states that he would reverse {w|Obamacare}, simplify the tax system, and cut government spending. 
[[U.S. Presidential candidate Michele Bachmann narrowly edges Ron Paul in Ames Straw Poll]]Representative {w|Michele Bachmann} of Minnesota narrowly defeated fellow Representative Ron Paul of Texas to win the nonbinding {w|Ames Straw Poll} on Saturday. The poll, held every four years in {w|Ames, Iowa|Ames}, Iowa is used as a gauge of {w|Republican Party|Republican} candidate viability several months ahead of the first-in-the-nation {w|Iowa Caucuses}. This year, nine candidates were listed on the ballot.Bachmann, the first woman to ever win the poll, waged a high visibility campaign that benefited from persistent media coverage to win 4,823 of the 16,892 votes cast. Following the victory, she remarked to her supporters that "You have just sent a message that Barack Obama will be a one-term president." Paul, who tripled his support from the 2007 poll with 4,671 votes, took advantage of an enthusiastic grassroots following. His campaign manager commented that the result proves he "is moving into the first tier" of candidates.Former Minnesota governor {w|Tim Pawlenty}, whose traditional ground-campaign approach did not work as effectively as expected, came in a disappointing third place with 2,293 votes. {w|Politico} felt the showing "may spell the end of his campaign", but Pawlenty argued that the campaign is "just beginning." He later withdrew from the race.The fourth place finish of former Senator {w|Rick Santorum} of Pennsylvania was seen as a "moral victory" for the candidate since he did not receive as much media coverage as the others, and did not spend as much cash. He vowed to remain in the race, stating "We have a caucus strategy, not a straw poll strategy...I don¡¯t think there is any question that what we did here today shows that we are building a base of support in Iowa."Surprisingly, Texas governor {w|Rick Perry}, who entered the race on the same day as the poll, was not on the ballot but was still able to garner 718 write-in votes. That put him ahead of the Republican frontrunner, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who was on the ballot but did not actively pursue the victory. He won the 2007 poll, but came in second to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee in the Iowa caucuses.Representative {w|Thaddeus McCotter} of Michigan, who paid $18,000 for campaign space, came in last place with 35 votes.== Sources ==

[[Indiana State Fair stage collapse kills four, injures forty]]At least four people died and forty were injured Saturday night as the result of a stage collapsing at the {w|Indiana State Fair}, located within the US state of Indiana. {w|The Indianapolis Star} has attributed the incident to poor weather.

Numerous patients, including adults and children, have been admitted to hospital. Weaver claimed that the incident could not have been prevented. Video footage of the incident, which has now emerged online, displays witnesses screaming as the rigging falls down.One witness, who has been identified only as Chris, informed the BBC of the events he sighted. "We could see the sky get really dark and there was lightening and thunder. It almost seemed like a hurricane hit out of nowhere. The stage just leaned to the right and crashed down. It felt to me like it was in slow motion. Everyone was scrambling and it was horrifying because you knew people were underneath it." He described the incident as "the worst thing I have witnessed in my life." David Lindquist, a journalist for The Indianapolis Star, described the scenario as "bad, very bad", and that one "could clearly see people were under the footprint of the rigging." Freeing trapped victims from underneath the wreckage took rescue workers under twenty minutes, according to Lindquist. No performers were left injured.A Twitter account representing the Indiana State Fair confirmed the fatalities and stated that their "prayers are with the families of all affected". At the time of the incident ¡ª approximately 2100 {w|Eastern Time Zone|EST} Saturday night or 0000 {w|Coordinated Universal Time|UTC} Sunday morning ¡ª US country music band {w|Sugarland} were about to perform.

[[Police social media frenzy threatens to prejudice alleged child killer trial]]Police in Queensland, Australia received an unexpected response from the public on Saturday when they announced on their Facebook page that a 41-year-old man had been arrested and charged with the disappearance and murder of 13-year-old {w|Daniel Morcombe}. Morcombe's disappearance in late 2003 triggered one of the largest manhunts in Queensland history.Within a few hours, hundreds had responded to the post. Many praised the Queensland Police and offered their condolences to the boy's family. However, several were highly prejudicial despite the suspect having not yet gone to trial. The police attempted to remove the inflammatory comments, but thousands had already read many of them, including potential jurors. Officials fear that this could make forming an impartial jury especially difficult.Police have charged the suspect with murder, deprivation of liberty, child stealing, indecent treatment of a child under 16, and interfering with a corpse.== Sources ==

[[Scots report crime using Facebook]]Facebook has revealed a new system in conjunction with the Scottish {w|Lothian and Borders Police} whereby users can report criminal activity and concerns to police using the social networking site. The "Made From Crime" initiative allows Internet users to anonymously report their concerns to police on a dedicated Facebook page that is being established to direct people with tip-offs to {w|Crimestoppers}. Police will also be able to send mass {w|Bluetooth} messages to mobile phones at public events like football matches to encourage the public to report crime.Designed to make use of the {w|Proceeds of Crime Act}, it will be the first of its kind in Scotland with the Scottish government, the {w|Crown Office}, and {w|Procurator Services} constituting the foundation of the service. Their backing will allow officers to seize assets that have been purchased through criminal activity.  Assistant Chief Constable Iain Livingstone of Lothian and Borders Police has stated to the public: "We know there are people living beyond their means on the proceeds of crime, be it through the purchase of flash cars, designer clothes or expensive jewellery, and that communities are suffering from the side effects of drug dealing, violence and other associated crimes".Justice Secretary {w|Kenny MacAskill} states that Lothian and Borders Police is tackling the problem of dirty money that has been obtained through criminal activity in a serious matter. Constable Livingstone has encouraged this, appealing  to local communities to provide information and come forth immediately either to {w|Crimestoppers} or the Lothian and Borders Police. Solicitor General {w|Lesley Thomson} QC has affirmed that they will take a robust approach to those that profit from crime, using the vast powers at their disposal though the Proceeds of Crime Act.The act has resulted in more than {Money|GBP|41|USD|67.0883|EUR|46.6571389|units=millions} in seizures from crooks.

[[Former Information Minister Describes Own News Articles As Offensive]]The British Government has released a document, which suggests that both reporters and top editors of {w|News of the World} used and sanctioned phone hacking.The release of the documents contradicts statements that {w|James Murdoch} and other News of the World executives made this July, claiming that the hacking was the fault of one single 'rogue' reporter. The documents included a letter written by a former reporter, {w|Clive Goodman}, the only person convicted amidst the controversy so far. The internal letter alleges that the phone hacking was well known by the staff and both supported and widely discussed at daily meetings. "This practice was widely discussed in the daily editorial conference, until explicit reference to it was banned by the Editor," Goodman wrote. He further claimed that he was promised that he would be given his job back if he kept quiet about the illegal voicemail tapping.In a statement recognising the seriousness of the letter, {w|News International}, the owner of the defunct News of the World, said that it was "working in constructive and open ways with the police and government".A parliamentary committee looking into the scandal has urged four senior members from News International and News of the World, including former executives Andy Coulson and Les Hinton, to reappear at the committee hearings due to the recent developments.

[[Pakistan government must investigate killings and abductions of journalists, says UN]]The United Nations on Friday called on the government of Pakistan to investigate numerous killings and abductions, particularly of journalists. ¡°In the past eight days alone we have received reports on the killing of one journalist, Munir Shakir, in {w|Balochistan} on August 14 2011, and the disappearance of another journalist, Rehmatullah Daparkhel, three days earlier in {w|North Waziristan} on August 11,¡± said spokesperson for the {w|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}, Rupert Colville.According to the {w|Committee to Protect Journalists}, nine journalists have been killed in Pakistan this year, and at least 16 were killed in 2010. None of the killings had been investigated satisfactorily, Colville said. Colville said that the UN would like to see the government review all of the incidents. ¡°We call on all responsible parties to immediately stop such violations of human rights, and we urge the government to take immediate steps to independently investigate these cases,¡± he said. Amnesty International has also urged the government of Pakistan to ensure the protection of journalists and media workers in the country. They have further called upon the Pakistani authorities to investigate attacks on journalists and to try those responsible in line with internationally recognised standards of human rights.Colville said that the recent attacks on journalists were not uncommon in Pakistan and that many journalist groups regard the country as one of the most dangerous places to work.Shakir was shot dead after covering a protest organized by a Baloch separatist organization. Irshad Matsoi, the bureau chief for the Online News Network where Shakir worked, said that the killing was linked to the journalist¡¯s work. Journalism in Balochistan is becoming ¡°an endangered profession,¡± Matsoi said. The whereabouts of Daparkhel, kidnapped on August 11, is still unknown. The worldwide press freedom organization said that the government must do everything they can to find him immediately. ¡°It is unacceptable that local journalists have to do the job of the police and investigate on their own using their contacts,¡± the organization said. The {w|Human Rights Commission of Pakistan} has condemned the incidents. ¡°There is a growing sense of insecurity among media persons who increasingly interpret each attack on journalists as a warning to ¡®behave,¡¯¡± the HRCP said last Monday. The HRCP also said that in almost all cases of violence against journalists in the last few years, those responsible have not been identified or punished. ¡°The HRCP calls upon the government to respond through effective action and not mere words in the next few days, sending a strong message to the mischief makers that it would no longer stand by as a mere spectator as journalists are killed and snatched,¡± the Commission said. == Sources == 
[[Guyana president's libel case heard in court]]Guyana's President {w|Bharrat Jagdeo} seeks more than {w|Guyanese dollar|GUY$}10 million in damages for an article published in {w|Kaieteur News} suggesting he was a racist, a court heard on Friday.The June 2010 article headed "King Kong sent his goons to disrupt the conference" prompted Jagdeo to sue the newspaper, columnist {w|Freddie Kissoon} who wrote the article, Editor Adam Harris and {w|National Media and Publishing Company Ltd}.The President's affidavit stated, "For the respondents/defendants to publish the aforesaid allegations is not only libelous but is also malicious, irresponsible and inflammatory, calculated and designed to excite racial hostilities amongst the people of Guyana and to cause a racial rift between the people of Guyana and their democratically elected Government."Dr Roger Luncheon, Head of the Presidential Secretariat testified in the proceedings, and told Justice Ian Chang that he was convinced the article accused President Jagdeo of being a racist, leaving the reader with a negative connotation. The witness said that the newspaper published a number of articles which implied members of the Cabinet and Government officials were racist and discriminatory towards {w|Afro-Guyanese}. Luncheon stated that he had never seen any evidence of racism or racial policies practised by the President or the Government. Jagdeo contended that the article had caused "great public embarrassment, held us up to odium and ridicule, both nationally and internationally."Nigel Hughes cross-examined Luncheon for the defence, asking about the ethnicity of the persons serving overseas as Government diplomats and head of agencies. He replied that they were Indians, with the exception of one person. Attorney of law Anil Nandlall interrupted, arguing there was no justification for the defence to be pursuing cross-examination of that description, which sparked legal arguments between the lawyers of the President and the defendants.The matter was adjourned to Wednesday for continuation and ruling.== Sources == 
[[Egypt recalls envoy in Israel]]Yasser Reda Ali Abdullah Said, the Egyptian ambassador in Israel, was recalled by the Egyptian government yesterday, who claim that the countries' 1979 peace treaty had been breached by the killing of five Egyptian security personnel as Israeli forces pursued cross-border raiders.Attacks inside Israel which killed eight Israelis led to what Reuters describes as the most acute crisis in ties between the countries since Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in February, with Egyptian troops being killed in a subsequent shootout between Israeli soldiers pursuing the militants along the Israeli-Egypt border.The Egyptian cabinet, in an official statement, said that they laid "the political and legal responsibility for the incident, which constitutes a breach of the peace treaty" between the countries, on Israel. They also ordered foreign minister {w|Mohamed Kamel Amr} to summon the Israeli ambassador and demand an official condemnation from Israeli leaders for their statements accusing Egyptian military rulers of losing their grasp on the {w|Sinai peninsula}, a huge desert buffer zone between Egypt and Israel.A few hundred Egyptians burned Israeli flags and tore down metal barriers, at the Israeli embassy in Cairo, demanding the expulsion of the Israeli envoy."One thing is sure, there is not a single person in Israel who wants to harm an Egyptian policeman or soldier," Amos Gilad, a liaison officer with the Palestinians and Egypt, said on {w|Kol Yisrael}.Israeli Prime Minister {w|Benjamin Netanyahu} consulted cabinet ministers about a potential response.The Egyptians had also recalled their ambassador in {w|Tel Aviv} on previous occasions, such as Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and during the heavy Israeli shelling of the Gaza Strip in 2000."The cabinet committee has decided to withdraw the Egyptian ambassador in Israel until the result of investigations by the Israeli authorities is provided and an apology from the Israeli leadership over the hasty and regrettable statements about Egypt is given," the cabinet statement said.Citing concern about security in the {w|Sinai Peninsula}, the Israelis said the attackers infiltrated from the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas, through the Egypt-controlled Sinai Desert, despite Egyptian security's attempts to find the {w|Islamism|Islamist} radicals.Cairo rejected the accusation which stated that it had lost control of Sinai. The cabinet's decisions came after a meeting attended by generals in the army and {w|Murad Muwafi}, the Egyptian intelligence chief.The cabinet statement also added that "Egypt will take every precaution to secure its border with Israel to deter any infiltrators, and to respond to any Israeli military activity toward the Egyptian border."The peace treaty of 1979 limits the number of troops Egypt can deploy in the Sinai. Emad Gad, senior researcher at Cairo's {w|Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies}, said that neither Egypt nor Israel was keen to escalate the issue further. "Withdrawing the Egyptian ambassador is a good step but Egypt still has to insist on a formal apology from Israel," he added.The Cairo-based {w|Arab League} will hold an urgent meeting on Sunday in order to discuss the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip, following the attacks on Israel, that killed fifteen Palestinians.
[[Red Arrows pilot killed at 2011 Bournemouth air display]]Flight Lieutenant Jon "Eggman" Egging, 33, of the {w|RAF} Aerobatic Team has been killed in a crash, shortly after a display in {w|Bournemouth}, England.  This is the first fatality involving the team for 23 years.The {w|BAE Hawk} jet aircraft crashed at 13:50 BST on the banks of river Stour, near {w|Throop, Dorset|Throop} village.  A witness, Shaun Spencer-Perkins, said the aircraft "bounced across the field [and] ... across the river.  Members of the public jumped into the water to search for the cockpit."  {w|Bournemouth Airport} closed briefly, following the incident, but has since reopened and is operating normally.Emergency services were called to the scene, but Egging, who was reportedly thrown clear of the cockpit during the crash, was pronounced dead at the scene, local police announced.  He joined the team in autumn 2010 and is the first active member of the team to be killed since 1988.  The {w|Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence} is investigating the cause of the accident.Egging is believed to have been attempting to avoid nearby houses before the crash.  Local residents, who were attempting to rescue the pilot, found an empty ejector seat and parachute at the scene, and believed the pilot to be already dead when they found him.So far, there is no official explanation for the accident.  Amateur footage of the accident shows the aircraft making a tight turn as part of a fan-out manoeuvre, along with other aircraft from the team.  Egging's aircraft then heads towards the horizon, with no apparent radical course change or additional manoeuvre, before disappearing out of sight behind a building.  All the aircraft leave a white trail of smoke behind the aircraft, as is a routine part of the Red Arrows display.== Sources == 
[[La Liga fixtures face delay due to players' strike]]A proposed players' strike could postpone the start of {w|La Liga}, the top professional {w|association football} division of the Spanish {w|Spanish football league system|football league system}.Spanish football functionaries and players will hold last minute talks on Friday to avert a strike that could see the start of the Spanish football season postponed. If the talks fail, the strike would be first strike of its kind since 1984. The strike was called due to the growing issue of unpaid wages. The disagreement rises from Spain's bankruptcy laws, which allow for the payment of wages to be delayed like any other debt. Six teams in Spain's top flight are currently {w|bankrupt} and owe over 200 players close to {w|US$}72 million.Spain's footballers will go on strike from Friday to Monday, canceling the start of both the first and second divisions. Top clubs, {w|FC Barcelona|Barcelona} and {w|Real Madrid} will be the high profile casualties of this postponement. There has been almost universal support for the strike with coaches and players of many clubs supporting the strike. Barcelona forward {w|David Villa} said: "We have made clear that all the players support the players' association, if a solution is not found, we won't play." When {w|RCD Mallorca|Mallorca} coach {w|Michael Laudrup} was asked to comment, he made his stance clear by saying "I think it's ok what the players are doing now," pointing to the discrepancies between the riches of Barcelona, Real Madrid and the rest of Spanish football.Further talks are expected to take place on Saturday and Monday.== Sources ==

[[Social networks asked to visit UK Home Office after riots]]Representatives of leading social network platforms have been asked to attend a meeting at the United Kingdom's Home Office to discuss their role in the recent UK riots. The meeting, scheduled to take place on Thursday, comes after rioters used the networks to further fuel violence and looting that occurred earlier this month. Officials from Facebook have confirmed that they will be present, but Twitter has yet to indicate whether they will attend. {w|BlackBerry Messenger} has suggested that it might attend."We look forward to meeting with the home secretary to explain the measures we have been taking to ensure that Facebook is a safe and positive platform for people in the UK at this challenging time," Facebook said in a statement given to the BBC.

Two of those already charged include Jordon Blackshaw, 21, and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, who last Wednesday were each sentenced to four years imprisonment.The four-year sentences have been considered the most severe punishment handed down amidst the recent UK riots. Presiding over the case, Judge Elgan Edwards stated that he hoped the sentences would serve as deterrents to similar unrest.     == Sources == 
[[New Internet law in Missouri to control social media]]Libyan rebels edged closer to the capital city of Tripoli on Sunday to help fellow mutineers inside the city who declared a final clash with leader Muammar Gaddafi.Following a night marred with gunfire, the rebels said that they controlled a handful of Tripoli's localities. With the rebels within about 25 km of Tripoli, Gaddafi's hold on power looks fragile. He labelled the rebels, who had been fighting for the past six months, as "rats" and said that he would not yield to their demands. A coordinated revolt that rebels had been secretly planning for months saw gunfire across Tripoli, instantly after Muslim clerics called people onto the streets. The revolution, combined with rebels advancing to the capital's periphery, appears to signal the critical chapter in the "{w|Arab Spring}" uprising, which is in its sixth-month now."The rebels may have risen too early in Tripoli and the result could be a lot of messy fighting," said {w|Oliver Miles}, a former British ambassador to Libya. "The regime may not have collapsed in the city to quite the extent they think it has."The rebels' advance toward the city was quick, and the mutineers have halved the distance between them and the capital. Government forces put up a brief fight at the village of {w|Al-Maya}, leaving behind a burned-out tank, and some torched cars. On their way to Tripoli, the rebels paused long enough and filled some walls with {w|graffiti}, one reading: "We are here and we are fighting Gaddafi."In Benghazi, the rebels' main stronghold and the genesis of the revolt, a senior official said everything was going according to plan. "Our revolutionaries are controlling several neighborhoods and others are coming in from outside the city to join their brothers at this time," said {w|Abdel Hafiz Ghoga}, vice chairman of the rebel {w|National Transition Council}.Gaddafi ¡ª in hiding since the NATO attacks on Libya in June ¡ª said in an audio recording broadcast late yesterday that he had no intention of succumbing to the rebellion. A spokesman for Gaddafi, {w|Moussa Ibrahim}, in a briefing for foreign reporters echoed the message of defiance and said: "The armed units defending Tripoli from the rebels wholeheartedly believe that if this city is captured, the blood will run everywhere; so they may as well fight to the end.""We hold {w|Barack Obama|Mr. Obama}, {w|David Cameron|Mr. Cameron} and {w|Nicolas Sarkozy|Mr. Sarkozy} morally responsible for every single unnecessary death that takes place in this country," he added, referring to the leaders of NATO members, the United States, United Kingdom, and France.Underground rebel cells in the capital had been following detailed plans developed months ago and had been waiting for a signal to start. The signal was "iftar" ¨C the moment when Muslims who observe the holy months of {w|Ramadan} break their daily fast. Imams started broadcasting their message from the loudspeakers of mosques and minarets.A rebel activist in the city said pro-Gaddafi forces had put {w|snipers} on the rooftops of buildings around {w|Bab al-Aziziyah}, Gaddafi's compound, and on the top of a nearby water tower.State television flashed a message urging citizens not to allow rebels to hide on their rooftops. "Agents and al Qaeda members are trying to destabilize and sabotage the city. You should prevent them from exploiting your houses and buildings, confront them and cooperate with counter-terrorism units, to capture them," it read.
[[Freshwater lakes in Texas show signs of extreme drought]]Extreme drought conditions this summer have reduced many of Texas' freshwater lakes to a fraction of their usual water levels. Central Texas, home to Lake Buchanan and Lake Travis, has seen severe effects of the drought. Those two lakes are currently 45 percent full and further drops in water levels are anticipated.  Austin, the state's capital, has recorded 70 days of 100-degree heat already this summer.The state saw less than an inch of rainfall in July alone. Residents of Henderson county are concerned that {w|Lake Palestine} has reached levels which haven't been seen since the 1980's. Some report that fishing in general has been hard-hit. Residents also report excessive sightings of snakes in and around residential areas near the lake, an effect believed to be caused by drought conditions.Collectively, estimates recently showed the state's reservoirs to be at 68% capacity. Chris Ransom of Houston told Wikinews on August 21 that {w|Sheldon Reservoir} is "all dried up now." He went on to state that Lake Houston water levels have dropped significantly this summer. He also stated that, while an avid fisherman, he's ceased almost all such activities within the past few weeks.

[[Former Wikileaks employee destroys unpublished leaked documents]]A former Wikileaks employee has destroyed 3,500 unpublished leaks to Julian Assange¡¯s site, and taken the site¡¯s encrypted system to create a spinoff project.Domscheit-Berg took the whistle-blower site's submission system to create a rival-site, {w|OpenLeaks}, consequently Wikileaks will not be able to receive online leaked files, and will have to use "snail mail" from an Australian PO box.In an interview with {w|Der Spiegel}, Domscheit-Berg said the unpublished documents had been shredded to protect their sources. In his book published this year, 'Inside Wikileaks', he revealed his motives for destroying the files and taking the encrypted system, writing, "children shouldn¡¯t play with guns". He stated the material would be returned to Assange "if and when he can prove that he can store the material securely and handle it carefully".Wikileaks retaliated, claiming the destroying of documents hindered the "leaking of many issues of public importance", accusing Domsheit-Berg of theft and sabotage. Via twitter, Wikileaks gave several responses over the weekend, writing, "DDB spits on every courageous whistleblower who leaked data if they destroy the keys and refuse to return it".In a statement made by Wikileaks, Assange claims Domscheit-Berg was in contact with the FBI, and is assisting the US investigation into the site. Another statement from Wikileaks claims Domscheit-Berg has "repeatedly attempted to blackmail Wikileaks by threatening to make available, to forces that oppose Wikileaks, these private communications".On August 14, Wikileaks accused OpenLeaks of stealing its ideas. Domscheit-Berg aims to make the rival site a more transparent and democratic site than Wikileaks. == Sources == 
[[New York executive files $60 million libel lawsuit over insurance scandal]]A former {w|Marsh & McLennan Companies|Marsh & McLennan Cos.} executive has hit former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer with a $60 million defamation lawsuit over an online magazine article regarding an insurance bid-rigging scandal. William Gilman, a former Marsh managing director, filed a complaint last Friday in the U.S. District Court in {w|Manhattan}, over allegations Mr. Spitzer defamed him in a {w|Slate|Slate} article published a year ago. A copy of the complaint was made public on Monday. Gilman, who had a final insurance fraud charge dismissed in January, said Spitzer acted with ¡°actual malice¡± by suggesting that he was guilty of crimes of which he was never accused. Although he wasn't named in the article, Mr. Gilman complained that Spitzer defamed him by writing that ¡°Marsh¡¯s behavior was a blatant abuse of law and market power: price-fixing, bid-rigging and kickbacks all designed to harm their customers and the market while Marsh and its employees pocketed the increased fees and kickbacks.¡±¡°While Mr. Spitzer¡¯s statements do not refer to Mr. Gilman by name, Mr. Gilman is readily identifiable as the subject of the defamatory comments," said the complaint. "Mr. Spitzer was well aware of his own allegations as attorney general and the resolution of those allegations in favor of Mr. Gilman and yet, recklessly disregarded these facts."In 2004 Mr. Spizter, then the state's Attorney General, announced an investigation into the practices at Marsh & McLennan, particularly fees paid by insures to brokers who place business with them.  Gilman, who worked for the company at the time, was charged in 2005 with 37 counts of insurance fraud. Gilman¡¯s final charge was dropped last January."I haven't seen the lawsuit and so will not comment on it,¡± said Spitzer. "The illegalities rampant at Marsh & McLennan leading to their fine of $850 million and the multiple judicial findings of illegality are clear from the public record."Mr. Gilman is now seeking at least $10 million in compensatory damages; $20 million in general damages, including damage to his reputation; and $30 million in punitive damages.== Sources ==

Nevertheless, the Boston Fire Department investigated the roof and the inside of 111 Devonshire St. After 30 minutes, the building was determined to be safe.This is the second strongest earthquake to originate in Virginia since records have been kept, after the one recorded on May 31, 1897, near {w|Giles County, Virginia|Giles County}, which was estimated at a magnitude of 5.9.The {w|Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow} initially dropped 50 points after the earthquake struck, but later increased over 100 points.== Sources == 
[[UK electoral commission asked to investigate News International payoffs]]The United Kingdom electoral commission has been asked to investigate whether payments made by {w|News International} to {w|Andy Coulson} amidst the recent phone hacking scandal were illegal. Labor MP {w|Tom Watson}, who has been a driving force in the phone hacking scandal, called for the investigation after he believed that payments and benefits made to Coulson, including private health benefits and a company car, should have been declared as a political donation. Mr Watson has reportedly been trying to uncover whether Coulson declared these payments to the cultures committee upon applying for access to parliament.MPs are bewildered by Prime Minister David Cameron's hiring of Coulson without anyone looking into his financial history, and many have expressed outrage as the reports contradict evidence given by the former {w|News of The World} editor to the culture committee in 2009. He allegedly told the committee that he had received a salary of ?275,000 and that he did not have a second income.Coulson is expected to face further questioning from the committee about the payments after he is cleared from the phone hacking scandal.Coulson was known to have received a payoff after his resignation from News of the World in 2007. The resignation came after the conviction of journalist {w|Clive Goodman} for phone hacking.The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee has stated that both Coulson and {w|News International} should have informed the committee about the payments. The investigation will decide whether or not the electoral committee has been misled by Coulson, and whether the payments should be considered as a political donation.The committee is expected to meet in early September to decide on a plan of action.
[[Trapped journalists in Libya freed]]As many as three dozen correspondent journalists who were trapped inside the Rixos hotel in Tripoli for three days have finally been released unharmed.Reporters from organisations such as the {w|BBC}, {w|Reuters}, {w|Sky News}, and {w|CNN} were freed around 4pm on Wednesday. The group were being held at the complex by armed men loyal to Gaddafi since Sunday night when the rebels stormed Tripoli and violence erupted in the surrounding streets.CNN correspondent Matthew Chance said the journalists' captivity ended when the guards were told about the changing situation in Tripoli and realized the regime might be over. A guard told the journalists, ¡°Look, we¡¯re not going to stop you from leaving anymore,¡± Chance reported. Shortly after being freed Chance posted on twitter, "#Rixos crisis ends. All journalists are out! #rixos."All the reporters who were held in the Rixos hotel were not even aware that the rebels had taken over Tripoli. Armed men loyal to Gaddafi, including snipers surrounded the hotel complex making it impossible for any of the journalists to go downtown and report on the severe conflict which is making a traumatic shift in the six month civil war. The hotel was one of the only places in the city still controlled by Gaddafi's men.Reportedly, the power was out on Sunday and Monday night and all the journalists could do was light candles and wait. Gunfire and explosions were heard from the direction of Gaddafi's compound by journalists at the hotel. Trucks with machine guns were outside the Rixos and snipers were seen posted behind trees in the area. The journalists moved to the inside of the hotel to avoid being struck by stray bullets flying through glass windows. Information on the situation was posted on twitter by the journalists who were being held captive. "Very dark, very quiet at the #Rixos some gunshots cracking outside,¡± tweeted CNN correspondent Matthew Chance during one of the power surges. Later on he then tweeted, "¡°#Rixos getting hit by stray bullets."The dozens of journalists were finally transported in Red Crescent cars to another Tripoli hotel, where they hugged friends and colleagues.== Sources == 
[[Strauss-Kahn case dismissed]]Dominique Strauss-Kahn was freed of sexual assault charges yesterday after the New York courts found the accusations against him not credible. After the shocking arrest three months ago when Nafissatou Diallo accused Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, of assaulting her, the prosecutor deemed the accuser not credible due to previous false rape claims.The New York Times quoted Strauss-Kahn saying the case has been "a nightmare for me and my family". Taiwan News also quoted Strauss-Kahn who said, "I want to thank all the friends in France and in the United States who have believed in my innocence, and to the thousands of people who sent us their support personally and in writing. I am most deeply grateful to my wife and family who have gone through this ordeal with me."On May 14, Diallo claimed that Strauss-Kahn forced her to interact in sexual activity in his hotel suite. DNA on Diallo's clothes confirmed an interaction but whether the encounter was forced or not was unsure. In July, she falsely told reporters she was assaulted in her homeland which erased her credibility. Diallo and her legal team made a last attempt in the criminal case, filing a motion on Monday asking that Mr. Vance¡¯s office be disqualified but early Tuesday morning Justice Obus denied the motion. The encounter between Diallo and Strauss-Kahn was deemed to be consensual leading to Strauss-Kahn's freedom.Strauss-Kahn is undergoing accusation in another sexual case in France. His lawyers have said this is also a false account. == Sources ==

[[Apple executive Steve Jobs resigns]]Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, has chosen to step down from his post as CEO of the company.  The former {w|Chief Operating Officer}, {w|Tim Cook} will be succeeding Jobs as CEO.  Jobs resigned in a letter to Apple's board of directors stating, "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple¡¯s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know.  Unfortunately, that day has come."  In that same letter, Jobs stated that his desire was to remain as chairman of the board.Steve Jobs has been fighting {w|pancreatic cancer} since 2004 and has been on medical leave since January of this year.  This was Jobs' third period of medical leave.  He briefly made an appearance in March and June to unveil the {w|iPad 2} and the {w|iCloud}, an online {w|cloud computing} service.  In part of his resignation, Jobs left this farewell, "I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you."Tim Cook was personally recommended by Jobs to take over as CEO and has been serving as interim CEO since the beginning of Jobs' medical leave.  Before his post at Apple, Cook held positions at IBM and {w|Compaq}.  He is known for staying out of the spotlight.  Due to an operational overhaul by Cook, he is credited with the success of the iPad and {w|MacBook Air}.  He also stood in Steve Jobs' place while the CEO underwent liver transplant surgery.  He received $59 million for his performance in the position.Analyst Charles Golvin predicts that the resignation will not begin to affect Apple performance for 1.5 to 2 years.  Many of the new products are already under development and Jobs will continue to steer the company from his position as chairman of the board.  Art Levinson, chairman of {w|Genentech} and a member of the board, adds, "Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration".  A contrary view is offered by Charles O'Reilly, a management expert at {w|Stanford University}, who stated, "Great companies rarely go from strength to strength".  Richard Doherty attributes Steve Jobs' success as the ability to hold off on a product until it is perfect.  He states "A lot of products could have gotten to market earlier, but he wanted it better."In light of the revelation, Apple shares slid $19.37 in after hours trading¡ªa drop of over 5%.

In a live news cross, journalists broadcast back to the newsroom in real time when an event is happening. Melissa Mallet and Cameron Price and Producer Aaron Wakeley were sacked by the {w|Nine Network} after rival {w|Seven Network|Channel Seven} filmed footage of the Nine News helicopter sitting on the helipad at the time it was supposed to be in the air on a live cross near the site of a search for the remains of a missing schoolboy, {w|Daniel Morcombe}. Evidence emerged the helicopter had not been near the site of the search during a live cross on the previous day, as well.Channel Nine began an investigation after the footage came to light. The incident, labelled "Choppergate", has lead to the network's credibility being questioned. Following the scandal, Lee Anderson, Queensland news director, resigned after 25 years at the network.The Nine Network boss, {w|David Gyngell}, issued an apology.  "The integrity of the Nine news brand is the value of Channel 9. Integrity is paramount. ... Staff made a massive mistake, and on my watch. That will never, ever, happen again.

And I am seeking advice on the matter."Bruce Morcombe, Daniel Morcombe's father, said of his family, "We genuinely see it as a storm in a teacup and feel quite sorry for the loss of those people¡¯s jobs".

Al-Almin had served a prison term of nearly two years after he violating press restrictions and reporting on alleged co-operation between Sudan and the {w|Iranian Revolutionary Guard}.The release and amnesty follows a series of fresh violations of 'press freedoms', which resulted in the suspension of independent newspapers such as Al-Jaridah and Al-Ahdath on August 20 and 21. According to Mozdalifa Mohamed Osman, Al-Ahdath's newsroom chief, the suspension caused financial losses of {w|United Sates dollar|US$}10,000.No reasons were given for the suspension of the newspapers. However, the editor-in-chief of AlJaridah, Saad Al-Din Ibrahim revealed that his paper was suspended because it did not allow the security services to interfere in its editorial and recruitment policies; sources believe the Al-Ahdath suspension was due to the publication of information on a planned meeting between President Al-Bashir and the leader of armed opposition group {w|Sudan People's Liberation Movement} {w|Malik Aggar}.According to press-freedom watchdog the {w|Committee to Protect Journalists}, the Sudanese government aggressively attacks journalists through "contrived legal proceedings, politicized criminal charges, and confiscations". Amnesty International believes Sudanese press freedom is "openly violated".Press freedoms may deteriorate with the National Congress Party contemplating further restrictions, including the possibility of pre-publication censorship. == Sources ==

[[South African police probe 'racist' image on Facebook]]Police in South Africa are investigating after {W|The Sunday Times} highlighted a "racist"  image on Facebook. The photograph, showing an armed white man posing over what appears to be a dead black boy, first attracted controversy back in 2008.The new attention focuses on a Facebook profile going by the name Eugene Terrorblanche, with the Sunday Times printing the image on its front page alongside a police appeal for information leading to the man's identification. However, some local media reports that police have known since 2007 that the image was staged and the child was paid to lie before the man.Officials have noted the image may be in breach of the Children's Act, the {W|Films and Publications Act, 1996|Films and Publications Act} and the Criminal Procedure Act; the account's 590 listed friends have been warned that South African law may hold them criminally liable for failing to report the picture if it is not posed.Our correspondent was unable to locate the Eugene Terrorblanche account to confirm it is still on Facebook. Wikinews did find several Facebook pages in opposition to the profile; the most popular billed itself as an "antifanpage" against the man and had 1,939 "likes". One, with 523 members, called for the arrest of every friend of the Terrorblanche account.Wikinews has contacted Facebook seeking comment on if they will divulge user identity information to South African authorities if requested to, and asking for confirmation the account has been removed. Officials of the social network have yet to respond.== Sources == 
[[Wikileaks crashes under cyber attack]]Wikileaks today announced via twitter that its website has crashed under an apparent cyber-attack; this following the recent release of tens of thousands of US State Department cables. Sources in the US say the mass-disclosure of cables is causing diplomatic setbacks, and embarrassment, for the administration of Barack Obama.These previously unreleased cables are said to contain the names of sensitive sources that the authors asked higher bodies to "strictly protect". The authenticity of the latest documents has not been confirmed but, US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, "the United States strongly condemns any illegal disclosure of classified information".After more than 2,000 cables were reviewed by the Associated Press, they were found to contain dozens of sources who had sought identity protection. 125,000 sensitive documents have been disclosed in the past week, and their rapid release is said to be causing complications and endangering US foreign policy goals."In addition to damaging our diplomatic efforts, it puts individuals' security at risk, threatens our national security and undermines our effort to work with countries to solve shared problems. We remain concerned about these illegal disclosures and about concerns and risks to individuals", Nuland said.The first series of leaks began last November. With each release, officials from the State Department crisis management team went through the leaked documents, informing sources that had been named, and ¨C where possible ¨C warning those in authoritarian countries their identities may have been exposed.Wikileaks responded via twitter to the criticism as the cyber attack occurred, "Dear governments, if you don't want your filth exposed, then stop acting like pigs. Simple".News organisations were previously cooperating with Wikileaks in exchange for copies of documents, including uncensored State Department messages; the new flood of publishing in recent weeks reflects the collapse of those relationships between Wikileaks and the mainstream media."We continue to carefully monitor what becomes public and to take steps to mitigate the damage to national security and to assist those who may be harmed by these illegal disclosures to the extent that we can", said Nuland.== Sources == 
[[BCCI should be more accountable in its functioning, says Indian Sports Minister Ajay Maken]]Just a day after the Union Council of Ministers of India rejected the proposed National Sports Development Bill, Indian Sports Minister Ajay Maken said that the BCCI, Indian cricket's governing body, needs to be more accountable in its functioning.  Maken said that he was particularly disappointed with the opposition to the proposed bill by BCCI administrators and said that federations need to be brought under the remit of the Right to Information Act for greater accountability. Maken attacked those officials who are over the age of seventy, saying that seventy is a ripe age and the officials should realize that they should make way for younger people. He said that they have sixty years as age of retirement in bureaucracy, in judiciary it is sixty five and in others it is sixty two-sixty three, they have kept the age limitation at seventy years for sports federations. He said that transparency and efficiency is needed in the functioning of the sport federations of India, since they sends teams outside India representing their country, and they should be answerable to the people of India through RTI act.  The Sports Ministry of India wanted to get the bill passed by the Indian parliament in the ongoing monsoon session but the cabinet's rejection has put a spanner.   Explaining the nuances of the bill, Maken said having sportspersons in administration is a step towards transparency. "What we are saying is that 25% of the executive body should constitute of sports persons of the same game, we are not saying govt will appoint that 25%. What we are saying is that sports persons who have played at the national level, they should among themselves select, elect sports persons who should represent 25% of their executive body." he said.  "We want to give more power to sports persons, we want them to be transparent in their accounting and entire process, we want them to be answerable to the citizens of India because after all they are sending teams which is representing India as a nation," he added. On Tuesday, the cabinet which included ministers like ICC president Sharad Pawar, Mumbai Cricket Association chief Vilasrao Deshmukh, Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association head Farooq Abdullah, Kapil Sibal, All India Football Federation head Praful Patel and Kamal Nath rejected the bill. The ministers felt that the bill was seeking to control instead to facilitate the development of sports and objections on the age and tenure restrictions were raised. However Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P.Chidambaram supported the bill. Pawar also threatened to take up the issue with UPA chairman Sonia Gandhi. Maken stated that he remains confident that it will get the cabinet's approval the next time around. He said that ministers will be consulted to know their specific objections and they will be addressed as much as possible in the bill. He said that the redrafted Bill be presented before the Cabinet will before the start of the Winter Session of Parliament. Maken also told that Rahul Gandhi, an Indian politician and member of the parliament of India said that all sports bodies should be turned into Constitutional bodies, rather than enacting legislation with incremental scope.  In reply to this statement of Maken, the BCCI president Shashank Manohar said,"The BCCI is a non-governmental organisation, which has its own constitution and generates its own funds. In fact, there are two orders passed by the country's Chief Information Commissioner wherein it has been clearly stated that the RTI Act doesn't apply to the BCCI." However Maken stated that the BCCI indirectly received government funds. He pointed out things like tax exemptions and the land given to the BCCI by the government.  The proposed bill also called for the inclusion of former players in BCCI. "I can only speak for the BCCI which has its own constitution and office-bearers are elected democratically by state associations and other affiliated units," Manohar said. He said, "We have former players like Anil Kumble, Shivlal Yadav and Mohinder Pandove holding key positions in their respective associations as well as in the BCCI after they were duly elected to their respective posts. In BCCI, we only involve former players to deal with cricket-specific issues like selection, technical matters, coaching, mentoring etc, leaving the administrative issues to elected representatives." He also said,"All said and done, cricket is the best administered sport in the country. It is not as if the BCCI is a closed-door body. It submits its annual audited accounts to the Registrar of Societies after the same is duly circulated and vetted by its member associations."  Manohar cautioned against the possibility of government involvement in this matter, stating that ICC has recently amended its constitution and empowered itself to take action against Member boards in case of undue government interference in functional matters.  Different comments on the National Sports Bill have been made since now. Anurag Thakur, member of the Bharatiya Janata Party and President of Himachal Cricket Association, strongly opposed the attempt to bring BCCI under RTI act saying that since BCCI do not take any aid from the government in any form, the sports minister should refrain from making such suggestions. Despite of his bitter relations with the BCCI, former IPL chief Lalit Modi supported the cricket board and termed the government's interference into sports bodies as unwarranted.  However, former cricketers Bishen Singh Bedi and Kapil Dev have supported this suggestion. "BCCI may be the best run organisation in the country and may not  be taking money or aid from the government but nothing should prevent it to make it accountable", Bedi said in a interview. He also said,"There are persons who have been sticking to their positions for more then thirty years or even more in some cases but refuse to retire. The government has rightly fixed 70 year as the maximum age or maximum of three terms for holding office. What is more noteworthy is that all these are honourary jobs and they get nothing out of it except making money through illegal means." This statement of Bedi was supported by former Indian captain Kapil Dev, who said that every sporting body should be made accountable, which includes the BCCI. The Association of Dronacharya awardees, a association of the awardees of the Dronacharya Award, an award presented by the government of India for excellence in sports coaching, supported the original bill by Ajay Maken.  On September 01, 2011, Farooq Abdullah, part of the cabinet which rejected the proposed National Sports Development Bill, took exception to Ajay Maken's remarks on Union Cabinet's "internal deliberations" on the bill, accusing him of violating oath of secrecy. He said that no minister has the right to brief about internal deliberations of the Cabinet until and unless decided by the Cabinet as it is the violation of the oath of secrecy.
[[Documents regarding post-9/11 prisoner transport flights released]]During a court case between two US charter aircraft companies, documents have been released detailing flights chartered by the US government from private sector companies in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks to transport prisoners suspected of links to terrorism.The documents, totalling more than 1,700 pages, were released as part of a court case dating to 2007 between {w|Sportsflight Airways|Sportsflight} and Richmor Aviation.  The case concerned over {w|US dollar|US$}1.15 million Richmor claimed it was owed by Sportsflight to cover costs associated with flights operated for the US government by {w|DynCorp}, another company involved in what have been dubbed rendition flights. Both companies referenced {w|Extraordinary rendition by the United States|the practice} in their legal arguments.Details within the files, including flights of aircraft, correspond to known flights made as part of the program; for example, one file matches the transportation of {w|Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr|Abu Omar}, an Egyptian cleric, to Cairo, where Omar claimed he was tortured.  Another matches the transportation of Encep Nuraman, an Indonesian terrorist.Other disclosures include that DynCorp, a major government contractor, was the main contractor for the rendition flights; Dyncorp had not been previously linked to the program. It was also revealed that letters from the US State Department were used to provide diplomatic cover for the operations, as well as evidence that the letters were possibly not genuine, since an official that signed them does not seem to exist.According to the files, Richmor, working with DynCorp, provided private jets and crews to the US government between May 2002 and January 2005, at a rate of about once a month. The planes were provided with State Department letters claiming their operations were "global support for U.S. embassies worldwide," and signed by a Terry A. Hogan, whom an Associated Press investigation failed to locate.The rendition flights were operated by DynCorp, which used aircraft supplied by Richmor, while Sportsflight and another broker, Capital Aviation, handled the finances.== Sources ==

Continuing his calls for an enquiry, he stated, "and they're very serious questions for the media itself to ask and I think many journalists want to see, and many people involved in news want to see a review and have a say and that's the job of parliament. That's why I've put the motion in to the Senate"'Senator Brown has labelled national newspaper {w|The Australian}, a "viewspaper", claiming it  mixes news with editorial opinion, "[i]t's very difficult for readers these days to be able to read news as news, as fact, as what's happening".Meanwhile, {w|Australian Broadcasting Corporation} managing director Mark Scott said there has been debate over whether a media inquiry is needed.The {w|Sydney Morning Herald} reported  Scott saying, "[a]s far as the ABC is concerned, we already have a very major inquiry under way". Adding that no journalist at the ABC could escape the broadcaster's editorial policies. "The same rules apply around independence, fairness, balance and impartiality across all programs [...] It is the same rules that exist around television, radio, around news".At this time, the Australian government has not reached a decision on any possible inquiry around regulation and ownership of news media.== Sources ==

[[Florida schools begin to enforce new statewide ban on saggy pants and other revealing attire]]With the start of a new academic year, schools throughout the US state of Florida are beginning to enforce a new law that bans students from wearing revealing attire.  The state legislature overwhelmingly voted earlier this year to prohibit male students from wearing their pants so low such that their underwear is exposed. Girls are also not allowed to wear low-cut and midriff-exposing shirts. Signed by Governor {w|Rick Scott} in June, the law comes into effect during the 2011-2012 school year. Florida joined Arkansas as the only states with such widespread bans against saggy pants.The law only applies on school campuses. Principals are required to issue a verbal warning to first-time offenders and call their parents. Students who repeatedly violate the law may be punished with up to three days of in-school suspension and up to one month of suspension from extracurricular activities. Gary Siplin, a Democratic State Senator from Orlando, had pushed for the ban for six years. An African American, he disagreed with accusations by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that the law infringes upon individual freedom and targets minority students. Citing a need to encourage professionalism and preparedness for college, he said "I'm not going to hire anyone, white or black, with saggy pants. I want to make sure our kids qualify."On Monday Siplin handed out a dozen belts donated by a local church to students wearing saggy pants at Oak Ridge High School in Orlando. Another 100 were donated to two other predominantly minority schools as students began their first week of classes last week. == Sources ==

The disruption forced the BBC to cut short a live broadcast of the orchestra playing Bruch's violin concerto. 30 people were removed from the auditorium but no arrests were made.The BBC made a statement regarding the disruption: "We regret that as a result of sustained audience disruption within the concert hall which affected the ability to hear the music, tonight¡¯s Israel Philharmonic Orchestra Prom was taken off air."Outside the concert hall, around twenty people protested with banners.

[[Study concludes 9/11 firefighters are 19% more likely to develop cancer]]Research led by the head doctor of the New York Fire Department, Dr David Prezant, has concluded that firefighters who attended {w|World Trade Center site|Ground Zero}, the site of the {w|September 11, 2001 attacks} in {w|New York City}, are 19% more likely to have cancer than similar firefighters who did not.  The study was published in the September 3 issue of {w|The Lancet}.The research compared 8927 firefighters who attended the World Trade Center to 926 of their colleagues who did not, over seven years.Dr James Melius from the New York State Laborer's Health Fund said the new research has limitations. Having reviewed the study, he said, "It is a major study, but it is not definitive.We know cancers can take up to 40 years or more after exposure to appear, so we know we're nowhere near being able to count them all."The 9/11 Federal Health Director, Dr John Howard, said, "I think it is plausible that many people will die of the many conditions we¡¯ve seen due to their exposure."  However, the link between 9/11 and cancer has not been officially recognized.  Dr Howard would be responsible for that determination.  Due to this, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act does not currently cover cancer treatment of 9/11 rescue workers.9/11 rescue workers have been previously shown more likely to have respiratory conditions.== Sources == 
[[Austrlian Green party leader criticises media ethics]]Teaching isn't just from books, it's preparing kids for the real world. I work in an office with a lot of young-fresh-from-college kids that can't handle the simple dress codes here. Kids have to learn they can't always dress how they want in the real world and be a respectable adult. Sorry kids but unfair dress codes are a part of life you have to get used to, better do it now when the penalty is a little trouble in school instead of unemployment. By the way, how much individualism and self expression is there in a played out 15 year old trend that everyone and I mean EVERYONE that has been in high school in the last 15 years has taken part in. Kids aren't expressing themselves when they sag their pants their following a trend, which is the EXACT OPPOSITE of individualism. What exactly are they trying to express? That they can dress just like everyone else? Their already conforming they just don't know it yet. We can't let high school age kids decide the rules base on what they think is fair, are you kidding? So teach the kids when they grow up, they may have to wear cloths they don't want to wear, that responsibility / respectability isn't always fun. Most importantly teach them that there are a lot better outlets for self expression and CREATIVITY then following someone else's trend. I have never, nor has any other adult, meet an employer outside fast food that does consider how an applicant presents themselves in an interview - welcome the the real world.

[[Military plane crashes in Chilean Juan Fern¨¢ndez Archipelago; reports say no survivors]]Four people, including {w|Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile} journalist {w|Roberto Bruce Pruzzo}, are confirmed dead after a Chilean military plane crashed near the {w|Robinson Crusoe Island} of the {w|Juan Fern¨¢ndez Archipelago} on Friday. Twenty-one people were aboard, with such figures as prominent Chilean television presenter and co-host of breakfast programme {w|Buenos D¨ªas a Todos} {w|Felipe Camiroaga|Felipe Camiroaga Fern¨¢ndez}, and businessman and founder of the Desaf¨ªo: Levantemos Chile project Felipe Cubillos.The accident involved a {w|CASA C-212 Aviocar} aircraft. Minister of Defence {w|Andr¨¦s Allamand} said on Televisi¨®n Nacional the crash "occurred in the late [Friday] afternoon near the remote Juan Fern¨¢ndez archipelago. [...] The scenario which we are facing is particularly adverse." The plane tried twice tried to land at the Robinson Crusoe Island aerodrome before going missing. The Defence Ministry sent a frigate with a specialized rescue helicopter, and an aircraft to the crash site to help search for survivors on early Saturday.Mayor of Juan Fern¨¢ndez Mr. Leopoldo Gonz¨¢lez Charpentier reported conditions were "rough and windy," and "aviation authorities lost communication with the plane as it approached the islands." "We assume that there was an accident and that there are no survivors. [...] Clothing, passengers' suitcases and some sandals have been found in waters about one kilometre [0.6 mile] from the islands' landing strip," Gonz¨¢lez stated."I empathise with the anguish and uncertainty the relatives the 21 passengers aboard the plane, which is presumed to have gone down, are living through at this moment. This is a very hard blow for our country," President of Chile Sebasti¨¢n Pi?era said on Friday night after an emergency meeting. A TVN executive said: "We are extremely upset." A group of five people from Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile's breakfast programme Buenos D¨ªas a Todos, including popular presenter Felipe Camiroaga, journalist Roberto Bruce, a cameraman and two producers, were travelling to the islands to film a report on the reconstruction efforts after the tsunami generated by the Chilean earthquake of February 2010 devastated Juan Fern¨¢ndez. Felipe Cubillos, from the Desaf¨ªo Levantemos Chile project, which he founded and whose goal was to help reconstruct Chilean damaged towns after the earthquake, tweeted shortly before the plane took off from Santiago at 14:00: "Travelling now to Juan Fern¨¢ndez Island with the support of our Air Force. We continue to work helping the island's people."Felipe Camiroaga, 44, was born in Santiago, and began his television career in 1988 as producer of teen program Extra J¨®venes in {w|Chilevisi¨®n}; in 1992, he joined Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile, working as co-host of Buenos D¨ªas a Todos with Jorge Hevia and Tati Penna, and in soap operas. Fourteen years later, in 2006, he began working as host on a talk show called Animal Nocturno, where he interviewed people such as former President {w|Michelle Bachelet} and former Miss Universe {w|Cecilia Bolocco}; between 2009 and 2010, he co-presented with Soledad Onetto the annual {w|Vi?a del Mar International Song Festival}. In July, and coincidentally, Camiroaga quoted Chilean poet {w|Gonzalo Rojas}, following his death: "From the air I am, like every mortal, from the great and terrible flight, and I'm here to step to the stars." The quote is reported of being "very inspirational" to Camiroaga. Camiroaga also created popular fictional characters such as Luciano Bello, a TV presenter from Maracaibo, Venezuela, and El Washington, a poor person from the streets of Santiago. Camiroaga was nicknamed "the Falcon of Chicureo", because he raised several falcons in his hacienda in {w|Chicureo}, Santiago Metropolitan Region.Hundreds of Chileans gathered outside Televisi¨®n Nacional de Chile headquarters in Santiago shortly after the station reported the tragedy; people prayed and lit candles outside TVN's gates for the lives of Camiroaga and the rest of TVN's involved staff.On Saturday, Chilean newspaper {w|Las ?ltimas Noticias} put on its front page a headline saying "The last flight of the Falcon" which generated controversy as Camiroaga had not been declared legally dead. The newspaper shortly changed the front page on its online version, however, the print edition continued to show the controversial headline.Four bodies were found on Saturday morning by local fishermen who are helping in the rescue; they were taken from the islands to Santiago's Medical Legal Service for identification, arriving 19:10 local time at the {w|El Bosque, Chile|El Bosque} Air Force Base. Their identities were made public at 21:30 local time by the Minister of the Government General Secretary {w|Andr¨¦s Chadwick}: Erwin N¨²?ez, from the Chilean air force crew; Galia D¨ªaz, from the National Council of Culture; Roberto Bruce, journalist of TVN's Buenos D¨ªas a Todos; and Silvia Slier, editor of Buenos D¨ªas....An intact door, several knapsacks, including one belonging to Felipe Camiroaga, and some equipment, lead the local mayor to assume "it was clear the plane crashed." Local councillor Felipe Paredes told Chilean media, "[t]hese persons came [to Juan Fern¨¢ndez] in one of the most tragic moments in my life. I lost many people of our community, many loved people, because of the [February 2010] tsunami, and they reached me out sincerely. [...] I can't wait for them to be here." Paredes was the last person to see the airplane in-flight, since he was in a control tower in the Robinson Crusoe Aerodrome.Defence Minister Andres Allamand said in a press conference on Saturday night that "everyone died instantly when the crash happened." He added that, "[b]ased on observations and the search we carried out with the Air Force commander, we have reached the conclusion that the impact was such that it should have resulted in the instantaneous death of all of those who were aboard the aircraft." "We have peace of mind that Felipe [Camiroaga] died in a place he loved," TVN executive Mauro Vald¨¦s told {w|El Mercurio}.Televisi¨®n Nacional released a statement on Facebook on Saturday night: "We profoundly lament to have to confirm that according to official informations given by the authorities, there are no survivors from the Casa C212 airplane that crashed in the Juan Fern¨¢ndez archipelago on Friday 2 September evening. Within the list of deceased passengers, there are five persons from TVN's program Buenos D¨ªas a Todos, which has caused deep sorrow in the whole family of TVN."On Sunday morning, a televised mass was conducted in TVN's headquarters; some of the attendants were former Camiroaga's girlfriend Katherine Salozny, long-time friend {w|Raquel Argando?a}, {w|Megavisi¨®n} presenter {w|Kike Morand¨¦}, actor {w|?lvaro Rudolphy}, TV host and producer {w|Guillermo Mu?oz}, and executives from TVN. Mauricio Correa, executive director of Buenos D¨ªas a Todos said during the mass "Our colleagues died complying a mission, the public television one, the same one that sometimes isn't understood, but that is right there." Kike Morand¨¦ said: "The best one died, Felipe [Camiroaga].""Felipe [Camiroaga] was a host on the national show [Buenos D¨ªas a Todos] I was on today, playing soccer with [him] too ... it's news right now that he was in a plane crash ... please pray for him [...]", {w|Nick Vujicic}, who was interviewed on Friday morning in Buenos D¨ªas a Todos by Camiroaga himself, said on Facebook. Latin celebrities such as {w|Luis Fonsi}, {w|Roc¨ªo Marengo}, {w|Lucero}, {w|Alejandro Sanz}, {w|Residente Calle 13}, and Pope Benedict XVI sent condolences to Camiroaga's and the other twenty people's families, TVN reported.President Sebasti¨¢n Pi?era decreed two days of national mourning, on Sunday afternoon in nationwide address. "The Government has decided to decree national mourning for the days of Monday and Tuesday of the forthcoming week, as a way to express solidarity with the families of the victims, and also the pain that has arisen throughout our country," Pi?era said. He also said that "work is being done with the best technology to find the bodies of the victims," but added that he can't "guarantee that the search will be successful in a 100 per cent. [...] We know the impact was very violent and the airframe dispersed in a wide area." Pi?era said that the causes of the accident are unknown at the moment, and added that weather conditions affected negatively the security of the airplane landing.The body of Erwin N¨²?ez, from the Chilean air force crew, was taken to Antofagasta after a mass was performed in Santiago in his honour on Sunday. That same day, Roberto Bruce, one of the two TVN journalists and father of two, was cremated and interrated in Parque del Recuerdo Cemetery in Santiago. "With tremendous pain we have just said goodbye to Roberto, our beloved fat [person]," TVN journalist and presenter {w|Karen Doggenweiler} said on Twitter.One minute of silence was held at the beginning of the football match between Chile and Mexico in Barcelona, on Sunday. On that same day, three books of condolences were set up outside TVN's headquarters.General Maximiliano Larraechea said that "at the moment there are no news on the search," as of Sunday 17:00 local time. However, at 18:15 local time approximately, Commander in Chief of the Chilean Air Force Jorge Rojas told Chilevisi¨®n that mutilated bodies were found in the water; Defence Minister Allamand confirmed that the recovered bodies will be taken to the Medical Legal Service in Santiago, in order to identify them, at 18:50 local time. Allamand added that "there are fears that not all bodies will be found," and that the plane "was disintegrated on impact with the water."Chilevisi¨®n reported that at least three more people, including TVN actor {w|Francisco Reyes Morand¨¦|Francisco Reyes}, and singer {w|Keko Yunge}, were originally going to travel to Juan Fern¨¢ndez on Friday. Reyes, however, was told to not travel because "there was no room for him" by Buenos D¨ªas a Todos producer Carolina Gatica; Reyes was going to travel because he wanted to teach Juan Fern¨¢ndez children "acting techniques." Yunge, member of the Desaf¨ªo: Levantemos Chile group, was asked by Felipe Cubillos to not travel, because he wanted Yunge to complete a song he was working on. "It is incredible," Yunge told Chilevisi¨®n.The airplane crash, according to El Mercurio, is the worst involving a military plane since December 1982 when a Fokker F-27 twin-engine travelling from Santiago to {W|Antofagasta} crashed near {W|La Serena}, killing 46 people, including journalist Silvia Pinto.

[[Bomb blast in Delhi kills 12, injures 62]]Twelve people were reported killed and 62 people injured in a terrorist attack outside gate number 5 of Delhi High Court, in India's capital New Delhi at around 10:15am on Wednesday.According to home secretary RK Singh, the explosives were hidden in a briefcase placed in the reception of the high court. At that moment hundreds of people were present on the site to get passes to attend court cases. Islamic fundamentalist organization Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami claimed the responsibility for these blasts. In an email sent to the media, the group demanded immediate repeal of the the death penalty given to Mohammed Afzal Guru, a terrorist involved in the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001. They also warned that they could target other high courts and the Supreme Court of India.Victims injured in the attack have been taken to All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Safdarjang Hospital. As the accident site is not far from the Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office, the Delhi Police have cordoned off the area.Politicians including the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader L. K. Advani, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M.

[[Radio Station Manager recieves six months imprisonment by Indonesian Court]]Gatot Supriyanto Bin Machali, Director of {w|Batam}-based Radio Era Baru, has been sentenced to six months in prison and has received a suspended sentence of another year in prison, on the charge of disrupting neighbouring frequencies and broadcasting without permission. The Independent Radio Director of 6 years may also face an extra three months in jail on top of his sentence if he fails to pay a fine of 50 million Indonesian rupiah to the government.Machali is known as a broadcaster to be incredibly critical of the {w|China|Chinese} Government in regards to their human rights records in many of his broadcasts. It is because of this that it is believed his broadcasts are the reason behind a diplomatic memo by the Chinese Embassy being sent to several Indonesian government departments in 2007 calling for the station to be shut down. Although the station has been denied a licence by Indonesian authorities since the beginning of 2008, Machali¡¯s broadcasts have still been aired; and the majority of them have included denouncing human rights violations in China, including violations of the rights of {w|Uyghur|Uyghurs}, {w|Tibet|Tibetans} and members of the banned religious movement {w|Falun Gong}.It was also proven in court that there are many radio stations in Indonesia without a broadcasting licences or frequency permits.However, broadcasts of Radio Erabaru are continuing to be aired and within the next seven days Machali plans to appeal the verdict.== Sources == 
[[At least four dead and hundreds of homes destroyed after week of wildfires rage throughout Texas]]Parts of Texas have been scorched by sweeping {w|wildfire|wildfires} this week. Officials state that a wildfire which swept much of central Texas this week destroyed at least 1,400 homes and forced about 5,000 people to evacuate to safety. An official with the {w|Texas Forestry Services} told news sources on Thursday that much of that fire has been contained.Officials have speculated that this fire alone has destroyed more homes than any other wildfire on record in the state. Officials are welcoming dropping temperatures, stating this will increase their ability to fight the fires effectively. A converted {w|DC-10} aircraft was recently made available to fire authorities, but cannot be used until Friday as workers still need to time to prepare on-board equipment.One of the two fatalities in the central part of the state has been identified as Michael Troy Farr, 49, who died at his home. Earlier in the week, a woman and her infant died in a related blaze that quickly engulfed their home located near the city of {w|Gladewater, Texas|Gladewater}, located in the eastern part of the state. On Thursday, officials warned that East Texas has become the center of wildfire activity in the state.At least 170 wildfires have ravaged much of the state over the past week. On Tuesday, a thick haze of smoke enveloped the city of {w|Tyler, Texas|Tyler} for several hours, forcing school officials to cancel all outdoor sports activities. Since late 2010 the overall devastation of wildfires in the state is estimated to cost at least {Money|USD|216|GBP|136|EUR|157.5|units=millions} in firefighting expenses. The state's Lieutenant Governor, {w|David Dewhurst}, who is the acting governor in Governor Perry's absence, indicated he will ask the federal government to declare Texas a major disaster area.

[[Gay men able to donate blood as controversial lifetime ban lifted in the UK]]A complete ban preventing homosexual and bisexual males from donating blood will soon be lifted in the United Kingdom. The UK Department of Health said Thursday that the lifetime ban will be lifted in November. However, the ban still restricts those who have had anal, or oral sex with another male in the last 12 months from donating. The decision follows a scientific review by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs, which concluded that improved testing, as well as evidence on how many people ignore donation guidelines, left the ongoing exclusion unjustified. The review also suggested that ¡°Much of the concern and opposition around the current lifelong deferrals for blood donation are based on a sense that they are discriminatory and reflect prejudice and stigma.¡±  Countries including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Sweden allow gay men to donate blood under similar conditions.  Despite this, the U.S and Canada still enforce a complete ban on homosexual men from donating blood. The lifetime ban was introduced in Britain in the 1980¡¯s in response to the spread of AIDS and HIV, and has long been classified as discriminatory by Gay Rights Campaigners. == Sources == 
[[Turkey threatens war against the Republic of Cyprus]]Following a dispute over oil and natural gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Turkish Government has threatened war against the neighboring Republic of Cyprus. The move comes after a 2008 incident when Turkish naval vessels harassed survey ships operating on behalf of the Cyprus Government, leading to fears that a similar incident could escalate the standoff between the two sides to open conflict. In a statement made by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan yesterday, the Turkish leader threatened to stop Cyprus from exploring oil and gas deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean. This follows a previous statement from Turkish EU Minister Egemen Bagis' claim that warships would be used to deter Cyprus from searching for oil in the waters south of the island. The island of Cyprus was divided in 1974 by a Turkish military invasion aimed at preventing the island from falling under the control of Greece. Turkish forces have continued to occupy the north of the island since. == Sources ==

[[X takes pole for the Italian Grand Prix]]For the second time after 2008 Greens and greenspirited people from all over Europe gather at the German-Polish border in the twin towns of Frankfurt/Oder and Slubice for a Green Summer University.  Hosted by the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament and the European Green Party EGP, Greens and green-spirited people from all over Europe came together to discuss the future of the continent under the heading ?Europe ¨C Make it or Break it¡°. Both campaign tools like creative political writing, video for communication or making use of social networks, and topical issues like the EU missions in Somalia, access to the internet as a human right or the consequences of the Arab spring for the European policies on refugees and migration were treated in a large number of workshops. Besides necessary regulations of the financial markets and the future of the Euro currency, more general topics of economic and industrial politics were one of the focuses of the Green European Summer University, which convened after 2008 for the second time in the twin towns of Frankfurt and its Polish neighbor Slubice. On invitation by the European Parliament members Sandrine B¨¦lier and Helga Tr¨¹pel one panel was tackling the question of access to knowledge and all the things necessary for a knowledge society in Europe. A radical approach to copyright laws was put forward by Professor Dr. Claudia Lux of the Federal Association of Libraries and Information providers: The copyright on books should run out after one year, when most books have disappeared from the stores, or at least after five years, when most content revenue cycles were finished for creators and publishers alike. Referring to the central role of Google Books she stated that every student today knows it, at least in the humanities. Having the world's knowledge in the hands of one company, an industry monopoly, was seen as highly problematic and when the question for Europe's answer to Google was posed, MEP Helga Tr¨¹pel declared that there was an ongoing struggle to include this in the next period's financial framework. She expressed her conviction, that the 'Europeana', the European Digital Library, needs to be included in the EU 2020 strategy, to keep the access to Europe's public knowledge free from the decisions of a private company. Jade Lindgard, a journalist with the subscription-based online news magazine Mediapart, declared the fight for paid content on the internet to be won: ¡°People realize that there are services on the net that are worth paying for.¡± The fight for quality journalism, however, would still be fought, she claimed, citing French newspapers in financial troubles over many years but surviving on state subsidies. Those, she said, made newspapers less critical and less likely to improve their performance. On the other hand, however, she lauded Wikileaks as a game-changer for investigative journalism. Tentative answers to the question of access to knowledge in the discussion included the pper-reviewed online science publication PloS One, the micropayment service Flattr, which works on a monthly flatrate, spread on different content providers like bloggers, giving them -and German daily newspaper ¡°die tageszeitung¡± some added income. The question of a real flat rate for cultural consumption was also raised.Working conditions in the new green economy were the topic of a panel discussion on Saturday, September 10, hosted by German Greens MEP Elisabeth Schr?dter. On the day before she had organized a tour of the solar industry cluster Frankfurt for the international guests of the event. Two very different photovoltaic companies, First Solar and OderSun, had been visited and working conditions and the business environment discussed.  Peter Ernsdorf of the German steelworkers' union IG Metall welcomed any now company in the business, while criticizing the lack of formal for most of the enterprises. With regards to the ongoing situation at Conergy he stated that the trade unions ¡°do not want to go to the trenches, but fight to keep as many jobs as possibly. Maybe it is feasible to let go of working hours instead of people¡±. The wages contribute, he mentioned, only five to seven percent of total production cost in this area. Lutz Hohlbein then explained how the workers council at Ersol managed to negotiate a Tarifvertrag with Bosch Solar Energy.  Rainer Hinrichs-Rahlwes of the Federation for Renewable Energy BEE, acquiring 24 members over its twenty years of existence, explained how Germany still is a paradise for renewable energiews, but with clouds on the horizon, especially for the solar industry. Rob McCulloch introduced the BlueGreen Alliance, a cooperation of trade unions and environmental groups, starting with the United Steelworkers and the Sierra Club, explaining how in the current situation in the United States, with the electoral success of the Tea Party Movement, the goal had to be to keep current reasonable regulation frameworks for clean air, because the Tea Party would block any attempt at further progressive politics.  Summing up the discussion the panel stated that fair working conditions are one foundation for the continued acceptance of the green economy sector, so that the green jobs created by it would not just consist of cheap labor, but provide decent workplaces.  == Sources == 
[[Texas wildfires push public resources to the limit]]A rash of wildfires in Texas in recent days has left many fire departments stretched thin on resources. Officials say firefighters handled over 18,000 wildfires in the state thus far in 2011; in a recent week there were nearly 200. President Obama declared Texas a disaster area recently.A number of wildfires around the state have struck near or even within populated areas. One of the worst fires yet struck near the city of Bastrop. That fire alone destroyed 45 square miles of land and over 700 residences, according to the Texas Forest Service. Wes Johnston, a captain with the {w|Chandler, Texas|Chandler} Fire Department, told Wikinews that earlier this month, his department spent 7 hours extinguishing a single blaze near Brownsboro. Captain Johnston, who is also an accountant, explained that the excessive number of fires has placed stress on his department's ability to cope with the demands. "Most volunteer fire departments [depend on] donations, completely; and donations have been down due to the economic conditions." He went on to describe how fuel and maintenance costs put further strain on most departments' ability to function effectively. "Even the cities have a set budget, for the paid departments, so they don't factor in a' lot of the variables for these types of incidents." Some volunteer firefighters in the eastern part of the state have averaged 2¨C3 hours of sleep per night recently, due to heavy demands. Even spouses of some firefighters have voiced concern over workloads.== Sources == 
[[Explosion at French nuclear facility kills one]]A furnace exploded Monday at a French nuclear research and waste-management facility in Marcoule, resulting in the death of one person and the serious injury of four others. No radiation leak has been detected and the stores of nuclear fuel, waste, and other materials have not been compromised.The blast occurred at the Centraco nuclear waste management facility, owned by French utility corporation ?lectricit¨¦ de France and adjacent to the Marcoule nuclear research center. According to Reuters, an EdF spokeswoman said "There was an explosion at the Marcoule site at 1306 causing one death and injuring four. We don't know the cause." She also assured interviewers that there was no radiation leak or compromise of nuclear material storage sites.Neither of the Marcoule sites contains nuclear reactors, although Centraco handles and produces large amounts of nuclear waste and fuel. The French nuclear watchdog ASN has opened inquiries into the incident, which in the wake of the Japan nuclear disaster has given extra arguments to the opponents of France's heavy reliance on nuclear power and opponents of nuclear power in general, as well as reducing EdF's share price.
[[Copyright on musical recordings extended by twenty years in EU]]The {w|Council of the European Union} voted yesterday to extend the term of {w|copyright} on sound recordings by twenty years, from 50 years to 70, preventing a number of early recordings of 1960s rock musicians including The Beatles from entering the {w|public domain}. The 1962 hit "{w|Love Me Do}" would have entered the public domain in 2012 if this legislation had not been introduced. EU member states have to enact the copyright extension within two years.The news was welcomed by representatives of the recording industry and by some recording artists. {w|Cliff Richard} has campaigned for term extension. {w|Mick Jagger} from the {w|Rolling Stones} said the decision was "obviously advantageous" to performers, and {w|Bjorn Ulvaeus} from {w|Abba} welcomed the continued control over the group's recordings: "Now I won't have to see Abba being used in a TV commercial". Geoff Taylor from the {w|British Phonographic Industry} said "[a]n exceptional period of British musical genius was about to lose its protection. As a matter of principle, it is right that our musicians should benefit from their creativity during their lifetimes, and that they should not be disadvantaged compared to musicians in other countries."Extension of the copyright term also has critics. Jim Killock, from the {w|UK|British} digital rights advocacy group the {w|Open Rights Group}, said the move "puts money into the pockets of big labels" but will be "unlikely to benefit smaller artists and it will mean that a lot of sound recordings that are out of print will stay out of print". Singer {w|Sandie Shaw}, of the {w|Featured Artists' Coalition}, said the move would be "extremely good news for record companies and collection agencies, but bad news for artists" and would lead to artists having "20 more years in servitude to contracts that are no longer appropriate to a digital age".The extension to 70 years is less than that EU Commissioner {w|Charlie McCreevy} proposed in 2008. At that time, Wikinews interviewed {w|Eddan Katz} of the {w|Electronic Frontier Foundation} and {w|Becky Hogge}, then Executive Director of ORG, in {w|Brussels}. The two organisations were gathering like-minded groups to oppose harmonisation with the {w|US}'s 95-year term. Characterising the sought extension as "Cliff Richard's pension", Hogge asserted, "[w]hat you've got at the end of the day with copyright term extension is basically [...] rent seeking by special interest groups lobbying governments to change the law in order that they may economically gain directly."Two reviews of intellectual property rights in Britain have concluded it would not be economically beneficial to extend copyright terms on sound recordings. The {w|Gowers Review of Intellectual Property} in 2006 concluded extension of the copyright term would "negatively impact upon consumers and industry". The {w|Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth} in 2011 concluded it would be "economically detrimental". A study conducted by {w|Bournemouth University|Bournemouth University's} Center for Intellectual Property Policy and Management concluded 72% of the economic benefits of the term extension would go to record labels, with 28% going to artists, only 4% of which are going to less successful artists.== Sources ==

[[FBI investigate hacking of NBC News twitter account]]Australia's Labor Party is expected to announce the terms of their upcoming media inquiry tomorrow, although it is expected to focus on privacy breaches and public complaints rather than Australia's highly concentrated media ownership.A government source was reported by the BBC as saying Labor would not lead a "get News Limited" inquiry, instead focusing on increasing the power of the {w|Australian Communication and Media Authority}, and ensuring a proper grievance procedure for members of the public.The justice minister, {w|Brendan O'Connor}, also suggested the government may toughen privacy laws to allow private citizens to sue for invasion of privacy.Opposition leader {w|Tony Abbott} has slammed the inquiry as "a naked attempt to intimidate the media", insisting it is the government's "performance which is causing the problems," not Australia's highly concentrated media ownership.Prime minister {w|Julia Gillard} said Australians were "disturbed" following accusations of {w|News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking} against {w|News International} in the {w|United Kingdom}, noting the company had "hard questions to answer".

[[Egyptian media under threat]]Fears have arisen that press freedom is increasingly under-threat in Egypt after the country's Al Jazeera office was raid by the country's security forces on Monday. The raid in which the security forces ceased equipment and arrested a technician was initiated by the authorities who stated that the station was operating without a broadcasting licence and that complaints had been made by neighbours about the amount of noise coming from the station. The recently established station, which is known for their heavy coverage of Egypt's recent unrest however claim that they applied for a licence in March but received no reply. Fears about press freedom in Egypt however have also arisen after Egypt's minister for media, Osama Heikal last week stated that the government would legally act against media outlets who "endanger the stability and security" of the country.Concerns have also been linked to the fact that officials last week announced that they would be temporarily suspending the issuing of satellite television broadcasting licences, something Eygpt¡¯s Chairman of general Authority for Investment, Osama Saleh said has been put in place in an atempt to improve media ethics within the country. ¡°This decision does not mean limiting freedom of speech, but it¡¯s a temporrary pause that should reuslt in further organisation,¡± Saleh said. ¡°A lot of media gurus and political activisits are convinved that these channels are actually seeking to spread choas and cause splits in the population,¡± Saleh continued about Eygpt¡¯s media.

[[Multiple lawsuits against News Corp]]US investors increase the charges against Rupert Murdoch while James Murdoch will be recalled to reveal his knowledge about the phone-hacking incident, According to the Sydney Morning Herald and the Washington Post. The last amended complaint accused Murdoch of misconduct, he was "accused by multiple parties of stealing computer technology, hacking into business plans and computers and violating the law through a wide range of anti-competitive behaviour," According to the Sydney Morning Herald. Latest developments in the case have led to 16 arrests including a former top aide to the Prime Minister as well as the testimony of James Murdoch, According to the Washington Post.  According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Two pension funds and New York-based Amalgamated Bank, accused News Corp of "a long history of abuses." The article uses a quote from Jay Eisenhofer, a lawyer for the shareholder, "revelations surrounding News Corp.'s corporate governance lapses get worse with each new disclosure..Our new complaint shows that the illicit phone hacking and subsequent cover-ups at News of the World were part of a much broader, historic pattern of corruption at News Corp., under the acquiescence of a board that was fully aware of the wrongdoing, if not directly complicit in the actions."The Washington Post adds that two former executives of News International claim that they informed Murdoch in 2008 about an email that suggests the phone-hacking went beyond the capacity of one reporter. The relevance of Rupert Murdoch is made apparent by the inclusion of the quote by Whittingdale who said, ¡°We spent some time questioning Tom Crone and Colin Myler last week about their version of what happened, and therefore I think it¡¯s likely that we would obviously want to put that and to hear more from James Murdoch about how he recalls the meeting.¡±Sheila Henry is also taking legal action against Rupert Murdoch for allegedly hacking her son's phone after he was killed in the London bombings on July 7, 2005.

However the plan, unanimously adopted by a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency¡¯s in Vienna, was criticised from the outset as being too timid, as its recommendations will be implemented on a voluntary basis only.Among the countries to raise objections were Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Canada. Despite the document being endorsed by consensus by the agency¡¯s 35-nation board of governors, meaning no formal vote was taken, the latter nation¡¯s official response to the plan was unusual in its bluntness.¡°The draft Action Plan before Governors today will be seen as a timid response by the Agency,¡± read the Canadian statement.  During negotiations over the final shape of the plan, the Swiss delegation charged that the agreement ¡°does not correctly reflect the reality of the nuclear risks that humanity faces.¡±The grievances aired the dissenting member nations centred on the plan¡¯s failure to obligate countries are to allow international monitoring of their nuclear safety standards. A lack of enforcement powers for the IAEA and time limits for the measures¡¯ implementation were also highlighted.Along with fellow critics, Switzerland emphasised that it viewed the plan as an evolving agreement which could be strengthened in the future. The plan means countries will be asked to subject nuclear reactors to stress tests in light of the Fukushima disaster ¨C where an earthquake and tsunami overwhelmed all contingency plans to severely damage three reactors, releasing radiation into the surrounding environment. Updates to international safety benchmarks were also included.Major players in the global nuclear industry, including the US, India and China, were vocal in their opposition to more stringent, mandatory safety requirements. US representatives to the negotiations defended the current arrangements whereby responsibility for nuclear safety lies in the hands of national governments, with the IAEA performing a largely advisory role. Proposals put forward by Agency chief Yukiya Amano, such as mandatory ¡°peer reviews¡± and international inspections, were scuttled largely by US pressure, according to diplomats. The 12-point plan will now go before a gathering of all 151 members of the IAEA next week. The watered down agreement comes as the Mr Amano claimed on Monday that the reactors at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant were ¡°essentially stable¡±. The IAEA director general said he was confident that a ¡°cold shutdown¡± of the reactors could now proceed as planned. Temperatures at two of the three damaged reactors have been brought to below boiling point by plant operator Tokyo Electric Power.To successfully achieve a cold shutdown, the water used to cool the reactors¡¯ nuclear fuel rods must stabilise at less than 100 degrees Celsius. The beginning of the IAEA¡¯s week-long meeting was also marked by an explosion at a French nuclear waste treatment facility. One person died and another four were injured in the blast on Monday, which French authorities insisted amounted to an industrial rather than a nuclear accident.== Sources == 
[[Killer Dog Owners facing Jail terms in Australia]]Ten year jail terms is what faces owners of Australian killer dogs, after changes have been made in the Crime Act after the savage death of a young girl.   These penalties are now at the same level of dangerous driving resulting in death.Four new offences are under the process of being added to the Victorian Crime Act so owners of dangerous and restricted dog breeds can face jail if their 'pet' has endangered life or caused death. A hefty financial penalty may also be charged.  Victorian State Agriculture Minister, Peter Walsh said "We are sending a clear message to the owners of these dogs: if your animal endangers life or kills somebody, you will be held accountable."  These changes are being considered within all Australian states, with the previous penalty being a simply low fine.Four year old Ayen Chol died while holding onto her mother's legs as the unregistered neigbour's Pitbull fatally mauled her.  Ayen's mother Jackaline Ancaito said "The only person that needs to be asking questions is the owner of the dog and the local council." Federal Attorny General Robert McClelland has agreed stating that the Federal Government "should be doing everything we can to prevent these kinds of horrific attacks."  A proactive doorknock appeal is underway to process the nations unregistered dogs, as well as a 'dob in a dangerous dog' hotline being set up by the Victorian Government.  Victorian Premier Ted Ballieu in the wake of the crisis has promised greater resources to find these dangerous animals.Laws on the registration of dogs are also occuring within the United Kingdom, after the discovery of a home with no running electricity and water holding 60 untamed border collies.== Sources ==

[[Journalist sentenced to 10 more years in Myanmar jail]]A journalist detained in Myanmar has been sentenced to 10 more years in prison, causing the international media to further question press freedom in the country.Photojournalist Sithu Zeya will now spend a total of 18 years in jail for allegedly breaching the Myanmar Electronics Act Article 33 by posting material online, a court ruled. He was originally arrested in late 2010 for photographing the aftermath of a grenade attack in the country's former capital Yangon. Restrictions on press freedom in the former military state have not been relaxed, despite the election of a new civilian government. The move has caused the international press to question human rights in the country."Recent events show that the conciliatory gestures so far taken by this government are just part of a PR strategy and are not indicative of a real intention to give Burmese citizens more media freedom," International press watchdog Reporters without Borders has stated. Zeya's former employer, Democratic Voice of Burma, believes 17 journalists are currently being held by the Myanmar government. It is also estimated more than 2000 political prisoners are also being detained. == Sources == 
[[Johann Levy Depends 'Jew or not Jew' iPhone App]]Johann Levy, creator of the controversial iPhone app, "Jew Or Not Jew" has defended the creation of the app, arguing that the application was not created to draw hatred toward any Jews but instead to showcase and honour notable personalities of Jewish descent. In an interview Johann stated that he was particularly proud of the Jewish Nobel Prize winners featured within the app. Jewish Nobel Prize winners he points out, make up 22% of individual Nobel award winners. Johann was also keen to point out that many well know tech personalities and entrepreneurs were of Jewish origin, listing the founders of several well-known companies as evidence. The original iPhone application was removed from the French iTunes store last night on the grounds that it was breaking French law. Anti-racial groups in France had been campaigning for the removal of the app, threatening to sue Apple if their demands were not met. Levy responded to the removal saying:¡°I did it out of healthy intentions. I am Jewish myself," Levy said Tuesday on French radio Europe 1. "The goal was just to bring a feeling of pride to Jews when they see that such-and-such a businessman or celebrity is also Jewish.¡±French law that was put into place after the Second World War could see Levy landed with a fine of around EUR300,000 and up to give years in prison. SOS Racism have said that they will file an official complaint at the end of this week. Levy has now created a modified version of the iPhone application which has been approved by the moderators of the iTunes store. == Sources == 
[[Southampton City Council votes against water fluoridation]]Plans to add {w|fluoride} to drinking water in {w|Southampton}, Hampshire, England, have been voted against by the city council, but may go ahead anyway. The council's vote follows heavy lobbying by 'Hampshire Against Fluoridation' including a petition signed by 6,000 people.The decision as to whether to {w|Water fluoridation|fluoridate water} in Southampton is up to the {w|South Central Strategic Health Authority} who decided in a unanimous vote that "the health benefits outweigh all of the arguments against water fluoridation".A Southampton resident, Geraldine Milner, had previously sued the strategic health authority claiming that the 2009 decision to fluoridate the water supply had been made, according to Milner, "without listening to all the people who said they didn't want it here". At the High Court, the judge decided in favour of the strategic health authority noting that "it is not the law that fluoridation can only occur when a majority of the local population agree" and that it was up to the strategic health authority to make decisions regarding fluoridation.Fluoridation is used in a number of other places in Britain including areas around Newcastle, Birmingham, {w|Lincoln, England|Lincoln}, {w|Mansfield}, and {w|Bedford}. Plans to scrap some water fluoridation plans in the north of England, as well as doubts about the cost of the scheme, have been used by campaigners in Hampshire to argue that the scheme should be abandoned.The {w|Health and Social Care Bill} going through Parliament currently would abolish strategic health authorities in 2013. Royston Smith, the leader of Southampton City Council, said that if fluoridation takes effect, it will not be reversible without further legislation.== Sources == 
[[Mona Lisa Stolen, 100 years ago]]Vincenzo Peruggia, decorator and painter, on the night of 20 August 1911 stole the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci from the Louvre Museum in Paris.  A young Italian emigrated to France, Vincenzo Peruggia had worked on the glass case where the painting was kept, then in the Salon Carr¨¦ of the Louvre. He knew very well the place and the habits of the museum staff.  Although guilty of theft, Peruggia was not to be arrested until late, when in December 1912 he delivered a letter signed "Leonardo" to Florence antiquities dealer Alfredo Geri: "The picture is in my hands, because it belongs to Italy; Leonardo is Italian." The thief said he wanted to return the Mona Lisa painting in exchange for the modest sum of 500,000 liras "for the expenses." The decisive meeting took place in Florence, on the third floor of the guesthouse "Tripoli"; with Geri was also the director of the Uffizi Gallery, Giovanni Poggi. The painting was in a suitcase under the bed,  in Vincenzo Peruggia's hotel room . The thief handed over the Mona Lisa to its guests so that they could verify its authenticity and took a stroll around the city of Florence. It was during  this walk that he was finally arrested.Peruggia justified himself saying that he stole the picture because he wanted to return it to his country: "to return to Italy the result of Napoleon's looting." Not knowing, as still do not many Italians, that the Mona Lisa has always been French in their own right, since it was sold for 4 thousand ducats to King Francis I  by an assistant of Leonardo Da Vinci, who inherited the painting after Leonardo¡¯s death. The Peruggia was sent to jail and the Mona Lisa , after being exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence for a few days, and for a brief time in Rome and Milan, returned to the royal halls of the Louvre, where it is still preserved.== Sources ==

[[Australian carbon tax legislation will cost billions to repeal]]As debate rages in Australia over the introduction of a carbon tax Mark Dreyfus, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change, has revealed that the new clean energy legislation contains provisions that will ensure that repeal is prohibitively expensive for future governments.The clean energy legislation, introduced into parliament this Tuesday, stipulates that a carbon unit is considered personal property. Mr Dreyfus noted that once the carbon change legislation is in place, repeal would amount to acquisition of property by the Commonwealth. For opposition leader Tony Abbott, who intends to win the next election opposing the tax, this means action to repeal carbon pricing laws would make his government constitutionally liable to pay compensation to all holders of emissions permits. This compensation, Dreyfus notes, could potentially amount to billions of dollars. The Labor Government¡¯s new carbon emissions scheme is considered one of the most complex in the world. Between July 2012 and July 2015, the initial price of $A23 per tonne will rise at a fixed rate of 2.5% per annum, before transitioning into a flexible price estimated at $A29 per tonne. The scheme works towards a target of 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050.The new legislation, which stands in stark contrast to Prime Minister Julia Gillard¡¯s election campaign promise that ¡°there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead¡±, contains 18 draft laws and 1100 pages. Despite the huge economic transformations that will occur should the bills be passed, Australian citizens have little more than a week to comment on the legislation with all written submissions due by September 22nd. Whilst international governments are ensuring that their legislation does not grant property rights on carbon emissions permits- allowing for environmental controls to be revised as necessary- the Gillard government is making virtually irreversible what is set to be the largest carbon tax in the world. The scheme is projected to generate carbon tax revenue of approximately $A391 per Australian in its first year alone- a huge figure compared to the European Union¡¯s emissions trading scheme, which per person has generated $A1.53 per annum since its implementation in 2005.The Labor government has stated that the legislation will be subjected to at least 35 hours of debate, and the lower house is set to vote on the legislation October 12th. Despite criticism that, if passed, the bills will undermine the democratic process by shackling future governments to the laws, the Labor government has the backing of independents and the Greens to push the legislation through both houses by mid November. == Sources == 
[[US plane crash leaves 9 dead]]A vintage Second World War era fighter plane crashed near the grandstand at a Nevada air race, killing nine people including the pilot, and injured 54 others, many critically, say medical officials. The plane, a modified World War 2 era P-51 Mustang, dubbed the "Galloping Ghost" that was being flown by Jimmy Leeward, 74, crashed at 4:30 pm local time into a box seat area in front of the main grandstand at the Reno Air Races, held in Nevada.The Federal Aviation Administration halted the air race after the crash, and was investigating the incident alongside the National Transportation Safety Board, an FAA official said. The head of the Reno Air Racing Association, Michael Houghton, put the number of injured at 54 people and said the 74-year-old pilot was among those killed. He said that there appeared to be a "problem with the aircraft that caused it to go out of control".Reno Air RacesThe Reno Air Races, which began in the mid-1960s and is an event that is held annually, feature planes facing off in multi-lap races at an airfield north of Reno.== Sources ==

[[Texas pays $294,000 in 2011 for security for Governor and wife]]During a year involving significant budget cuts hitting everything from education to healthcare, Texas taxpayers were billed in excess of $294,000 in security detail expenses for out-of-state trips by Gov. Rick Perry or his wife, according to records released by the Department of Public Safety. Destinations included the Bahamas in January for a family vacation. Anita Perry also visited Amsterdam, Madrid and New York unaccompanied by the Governor.  The Governor's spokeswoman, Allison Castle, told news sources these trips were for economic development. Governor Perry traveled to various locales including New York, Washington, California and Las Vegas. Sources say these trips included events such as promoting his book, "Fed Up!", speeches, and meetings with potential supporters for his presidential bid. Perry's campaign - not the state - pays for most of his travel expenses, but the expenses relating to the security detail is paid by the state.  The governor has said openly on occassions that his travel costs should be covered by the state because he's "promoting Texas no matter where [he goes]."== Sources ==

[[Malaysian PM scraps ISA]]I'm starting this up to try and draw general discussion about the review policy, and its flaws, away from C628's current reconfirmation. I'm going to start with a recap of where we're at and what's being done - partly because the last burst of discussion was a while ago, so many folk will be unaware.There's a proposal for a two-tier review system. Under this, the first-level review would take very little time and be a general once-over of the article. Such articles could be de-published etc, but would be sighted. The second-level would be what we have right now, and anything that went through that would be pushed to Google. It would not be mandatory. We have most of the needed infrastructure - a Google News Site Map has been built, and we have actually got two kinds of reviewer to hand out; we just only use one of them right now. As I understand it, there's very little left to work out, mostly minor things - what date goes on a page if the two reviews were different days etc. As a side-note, the GNSM would also make it possible to pull any article from GNews if problems turned up, as they sometimes do.The second proposal is just above - Bawolff's hidable inline citations, wherever his code for that has got to. I wouldn't want to make that mandatory, either; it makes articles much harder to write. However, I would like to strongly encourage those who're comfortable with it to use it as it would make reviewing waaay easier. I'm going to try and poke the folk involved in the technical side of these for 'better' details than I can provide. The key issue, for me, is that the current system only works at all if we've got enough active folk... But while it isn't working, we won't get the required growth.Now, hopefuly we can talk about review here and save C628's reconfirm - because, making that about the general issue is greatly unfair to C628 and led to me opposing when I might otherwise have supported. I held back pending wether I should ask for a little clarification, and now I regret that because it has become a support/oppose of policy and not a support/oppose of C628. Blood Red Sandman 19:31, 14 August 2011[I've had many, many consecutive edit conflicts trying to post this; I keep glancing at what's new, and just slightly adjusting therefor.  If we're not careful, the project will grind to a halt while we talk about this stuff.]Cursory review doesn't work.  It was my suggestion, and the epic fail I'm describing applies regardless of whether there's cursory review in place or not.  Note also that, although I place a couple of different kinds of importance on the stylistic stuff that makes some people claim we're rule-bound, the really important parts of review are the the massively time-consuming things included in "source checking", and those things are both what makes us not a blog, and what would have to be omitted from the "lower tier".There is an idea I find very interesting, that Bawolff has raised twice since I've been here.  Late review.  This is fundamentally different from the primary two-tier proposal, in that an article can never make it into the archives unless it eventually passes every criterion except freshness.  The state of this idea as I recall it:--Pi zero 21:58, 14 August 2011Let's try to get this discussion moving again, because I think we all agree that the current review system we have in place is unsustainable. If I understand the proposals correctly, we are now considering a two-tiered review system that still forces the lower tier to eventually comply with the standards of the higher tier, albeit at a slower pace. Hopefully this proposal will encourage more users to collaboratively edit the articles, especially if you have a banner saying "Help us fix this or the article will be unpublished!" Ragettho 14:42, 23 August 2011 I agree with C628. Another fundamental flaw in our current review system is that it deters the writers from producing the ideal article. Articles that are long and use too many sources take a long time to review, so they are often failed for staleness. Writers therefore tend to write shorter articles that use the minimum two sources, reducing the likelihood that the articles "fairly represent all sides in a news story". Quite frankly, I fail to see why the Wikipedia system wouldn't work here on Wikinews. Having a lower tier would surely reduce the quality of most of our articles in the short run, but over the long run the rising output of articles would ideally increase the amount of attention given to the project, and we would eventually have a decent crop of "good articles" that we can still be proud of. Ragettho 18:47, 3 September 2011We seem, regardless of what we do here on Wikinews, stuck with my main annoyance ¨C Wikipedians will never stop using their encyclopedia as a news site. There are those in The Other Place? who will concoct any excuse they can to decline appropriate links from "not a news site" templates to Wikinews. Then, our reliability is called into question, and use of Wikinews as a source is flat-out refused. I'm, frankly, past caring when it comes to that; in terms of competence, I feel the average Wikinewsie is worth any dozen, randomly selected, Wikipedians in terms of writing ability.Wikinews has outlasted at least a dozen other citizn journalism projects. Our biggest challenge is keeping to NPOV, and we by-and-large manage - content-wise - far more integrity and respectability than just about any mainstream publication on the planet.Can we find a way to make reviewing easier? I doubt it. It would, first, require that contributors be able to write extremely well in the first place. As any reviewer will attest, most can't.That I can't see a solution to the project's issues does not mean there isn't one; but, if someone cannot articulate a workable way forward in a handful of sentences¡ªwhich everyone sees as viable¡ªthen continuing this discussion is just an exercise in self-flagellation. --Brian McNeil / talk 22:43, 3 September 2011Since I was asked to address this topic whilst a very long distance from internet, I didn't. But I will briefly do so now:Beyond this is mostly mental masturbation. Feel free to continue to do so; I quit being involved with it after ensuring the primary issue was resolved technically. - Amgine | t 03:03, 4 September 2011I am a relatively new editor here at Wikinews, but I noticed the style guide conflicts with much of the content featured on the main page.  The guide states that all paragraphs after the lead should contain only one or two sentences.  Apple executive Steve Jobs resigns, Japan nuclear disaster: areas to remain off-limits for decades, and UK electoral commission asked to investigate News International payoffs all contain relatively long paragraphs and I believe it improves the articles.  I also think the information on the purpose of the first paragraph is a little too similar to encyclopedic writing.  I think that in a news article, the first paragraph should grab the readers' attention and lay out what the article is going to be about.  This is slightly different than a summary of the article like what is used on Wikipedia.  Ryan Vesey Review me! 04:36, 26 August 2011

[[Germans don't want to build any more nuclear power plants]]The German engineering group Siemens don't want to build any more nuclear power plants, several medias reported yesterday. This is another important step since 6th June 2011 when the German Federal Government decided to finish using nuclear energy until 2022.In the field of large power stations the company wants to continue to provide turbines, steam generators and other major parts, as these are used in conventional power plants, too. CEO Peter L?scher said the expected growth in renewable energies is realistic. The commentator of the left winged daily newspaper taz suggests this decision as a late change of heart.In May this year, Siemens had suffered a defeat in the arbitration proceedings to a contract with the former French nuclear partner Areva. The German company had negotiations with the Russian state-owned corporation Rosatom and was on a way in contrary to earlier agreements. Because of a competitive exclusion clause, Siemens is not allowed to make any competition against the French company Areva until 2013. According to the French it was forbidden even to the Munich-based company to act as a competitor beginning from 2012 for eight years.== Sources ==

The negotiation of the payout amount is the largest phone hacking compensation that has been reached by News of the World, reflecting that the phone-hacking case affected a family who were victims of crime. Milly Dowler's case was also the cause of closure of News of the World and resignation of the company's executive Rebekah Brooks.13 year old, Milly Dowler went missing in March 2002 and was later discovered murdered in a forest. A former nightclub bouncer was sentenced earlier this year of murdering the teenager.Claims that Milly's voicemails were illegally intercepted by an investigator working for the News of the World after she went missing in 2002 triggered a string of revelations that led to the closure of the publication in July.Murdoch personally apologised to Milly's parents Sally and Bob and her sister Gemma when he met them in London in July.In a statement, News International said it was "in advanced negotiations with the Dowler family regarding their compensation settlement," and that, "No final agreement has yet been reached, but we hope to conclude the discussions as quickly as possible."Police have arrested more than a dozen former News of the World journalists and executives in their ongoing investigation of News of the World. The British government has also set up an inquiry to examine media ethics and relations in the press.== Sources == 
[[News International offers ?3 million phone-hacking settlement to family of murder victim]]The family of murdered UK thirteen-year-old Milly Dowler, whose phone was hacked by journalists of the {w|News of the World}, have been offered ?3 million compensation by {w|Rupert Murdoch}¡¯s {w|News International}, in settlement negotiations currently under way.

[[Controversy over missing credit on Halloween II Blu-ray]]HOLLYWOOD, California -- The 30th Anniversary Blu-ray release of 1981's Halloween II, released September 13, is causing controversy over a missing credit.Universal Studios, the film's distributor, has removed the traditional credit "Moustapha Akkad Presents," and replaced it with "Universal, an MCA Company, Presents." The new credit's font does not match the rest of the opening credits. Akkad produced all of the Halloween films from 1978 to 2002. Akkad, nicknamed "The Godfather of Halloween," is considered to be one of the most important names associated with Halloween, because he put up the money for John Carpenter and Irwin Yablans to make their idea a reality. Without Akkad, there would be no Halloween franchise. Akkad was killed in the 2005 Amman bombings at the age of 75.Akkad's son, Malek, is furious over the removal. He calls the stunt "disgusting. It's a disgrace. Obviously, bias. Objectively, any horror fan would find this as an insult to the man who has done so much to the series. And to come after his tragic death, he's not even around to defend himself. It's classless."The younger Akkad says that he has contacted Universal and that they are "looking into it." A Facebook page has been set up calling for a boycott of the disc. The page currently has 1,801 likes as of September 20.No reason has been given for the removal, but some sites, such as Wordpress, Shock Till You Drop, and Ghoul Basment, believe that one reason may be that Lybian dictator Muammar Gaddafi funded Akkad's 1981 film, Lion of the Desert.According to the Facebook page, Universal promises to "fix the situation, and apologized for the error."== Sources ==

[[Californian law bans warrantless phone searches]]A new law in California requires police to obtain a warrant before they can search the phone or portable device of someone they have arrested.The new law overrides a ruling made in January by the Californian Supreme Court which apparently legalised warrantless searches, regardless of whether it was relevant to the arrest.The new law passed unanimously in the state assembly and was immediately enrolled as a law this week.The legislation will require police officers, who have cause to believe a portable electronic device is holding evidence of a crime, to first obtain a warrant before they can conduct a search of a persons personal mobile phone or other device.The new law may strengthen a journalists' ability to protect their sources as many journalists keep information on their portable devices. However Hanni Fakhoury, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that once the warrant had been obtained any information could be fair game for prosecution."If they have a search warrant, depending on it's scope, it might be tough to restrict what information on phones they get and how they use it", Fakhoury said.The Peace Officers Research Association of California opposed the law saying: "Restricting the authority of a peace officer to search an arrestee unduly restricts their ability to apply the law, fight crime, discover evidence valuable to an investigation and protect the citizens of California."The issue has been raised in other states, with mixed results. Warrantless searches are barred in Ohio but not in Florida and Georgia.== Sources ==

[[Despite last minute temporary reprieve, Troy Anthony Davis executed]]Despite international criticism and protest, and a temporary reprieve for a few hours, {w|Troy Davis case|Troy Anthony Davis} was executed last night at 11:08pm EDT.The scheduled execution of Troy Davis has been temporarily delayed by the United States Supreme Court. Davis was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at 7pm EDT at the {w|Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison} in {w|Butts County, Georgia}. Davis was convicted in 1991 for the murder in {w|Savannah, Georgia} on August 19, 1989 of Mark Allen MacPhail, an off-duty police officer.Davis maintained his innocence even in the death chamber: "I'm not the one who personally killed your son, your father, your brother. I am innocent... For those about to take my life, God have mercy on your souls. And may God bless your souls."Davis' execution date had been set three times previously but stays were ordered following repeated legal challenges including an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. On Tuesday, Georgia's parole board refused clemency to Davis.Protests and vigils have been occurring both in Georgia and around the world. Outside the prison, anti-death-penalty campaigners are praying, holding hands and holding signs. The campaign is being supported by {w|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People} and {w|Amnesty International}. Outside the prison, Rev. {w|Al Sharpton} told the crowd: "What is facing execution tonight is not just the body of Troy Davis, but the spirit of due justice in the state of Georgia."Davis' sister Martina Correia spoke on behalf of Davis' family: "Every year there is more and more doubt yet still the state pushes for an execution."A protest was held outside the {w|White House} primarily by students from {w|Howard University}, a {w|Historically black colleges and universities|historically black university} in {w|Washington, D.C.}. Amnesty International also planned a protest outside the U.S. embassy in Paris and a vigil outside the U.S. embassy in London.The British, German, French, Belgian, Irish and Green Consulates-General in Atlanta issued a joint statement describing "serious and compelling doubts" about the evidence at Davis' trial and called "for his execution to be urgently commuted". The {w|Council of Europe} also called on the United States "to find a way to spare the life of Troy Davis" due to "the serious doubts which persist about the integrity of the conviction".Spencer Lawton, the former prosecutor for Chatham County, Georgia, does not share the doubts of the protesters. He told CNN on Tuesday that Davis' defence lawyers do not have substantive evidence: "It has been a game of delay throughout. The longer the delay, the more time they have to create not doubt, not honest doubt, not real doubt, but the appearance of doubt". Joan MacPhail-Harris, the widow of the murdered officer, agrees and says Davis "has had ample time to prove his innocence" but has not.
[[Unauthorised autobiography of Julian Assange sells less than 700 copies]]Despite copious publicity, the unauthorised autobiography of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, published Thursday, September 22, sold fewer than 700 copies that week, according to Nielsen BookScan.Assange's autobiography, published by Canongate publishers despite his lack of consent, was subject to much media coverage. Yet Nielsen BookScan, the sales figures monitor, showed readers that week only bought 644 copies of the book.The Edinburgh-based publishers, Canongate, defied Assange's wishes about the publication of his personal memoirs, even though he had broken off all involvement with the project and withdrawn from the million-{w|pound stirling|pound} contract prior to the book's release. According to a {w|The Guardian|Guardian} source, Canongate used tight security measures to ensure Assange could not prevent its release.In March, after reading the first draft, Assange informed the publishers he no longer wished to release the book, and on June 7 formally withdrew from the project.Reportedly, the book describes his childhood in Australia; how he came to love computers and became obsessed with hacking; the founding of Wikileaks; and events leading to sexual assault charges against him in Sweden. Assange told Canongate that the book might be used by US authorities seeking to extradite him on possible Wikileaks-related espionage charges.Canongate claim that because Assange settled legal bills with an advance they paid on the book, the contract is still in place. == Sources == 
[[Battered Fukushima plant resists typhoon¡¯s onslaught]]Concerns about damage to the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been allayed for the time being after a powerful typhoon swept through Japan on Wednesday. Typhoon Roke, which brought winds of up to 180 kilometres an hour, killed at least six people across Japan and on early Thursday was centred 280 kilometres northeast of the capital Tokyo, raising concerns about the threat posed to clean-up operations at the nuclear site. The typhoon coincided with reports of a 5.3 magnitude earthquake which struck Hitachi, northeast of Tokyo, at about 10:30 p.m. However Tokyo Electric Power Company, the plant¡¯s operator, said that the Fukushima plant sustained no further damage as a result of these latest natural disasters.¡°We have not received any reports of abnormality or trouble following the typhoon and the latest quake,¡± said Hajime Motojuku, a spokesman for TEPCO.Although cooling systems continued to function normally, Mr Motojuku left open the possibility of damage to the plant¡¯s outer walls and other parts of the facility. The typhoon came two days after anti-nuclear rallies in Tokyo drew tens of thousands of Japanese into the streets of the capital. The protestors, worried by the lack of certainty over the consequences of the Fukushima disaster and dissatisfied with the government¡¯s response, called for an end to nuclear power in a country where the industry supplies just under a third of all electricity.Meanwhile, Japanese authorities are now hoping to successfully achieve a ¡°cold shutdown¡± of the Fukushima reactors a month earlier than expected, according to media reports on Tuesday. Radioactive emissions from the plant have been reduced to 1/4,000,000th of their initial levels due to successful cooling of the reactor cores, according to TEPCO¡¯s latest monthly review of clean-up operations.The reactors continue to require 550 tonnes of water daily in order to stabilise the still-hot radioactive fuel they contain. Cooling of the reactors remains crucial to prevent the dangerous overheating which led to hydrogen explosions, resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere, and to the meltdown of several reactor cores.In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is devising new safety guidelines in response to the Fukushima disaster. An NRC taskforce has released recommendations focusing on reinforcing cooling systems, backup power supplies, and increasing plants¡¯ ability to release pent-up hydrogen in order to avoid Fukushima-style explosions.== Sources == 
[[Shia killing in Quetta Pakistan]]The way Hazara nation is persistently being targeted in Quetta city clearly shows that there are certain elements within the Pakistan's security establishment who are not at ease with the overwhelming urban population of Hazara ethnic group in Pakistan in general and in Quetta in particular. This is evident from the endless mayhem of Hazara community in and around Quetta city throughout last ten years and continued support of Pakistani security establishment to the Islamic militants be it Al Qaida affiliated Lashkar e Jhangvi,Tehrik e Taliban or Quetta Shura. Owing to this continued support they kept continue massacre of Hazara community from time to time. The perpetual cycle of this politically motivated violance increased to the extent that it has claimed hundreds of human lives culminating to the death of above 600 innocent unarmed Hazara civilians including eminent politians,businessmen,sportsmen, lawyers and Government officials etc. Under the pretext of sectarianism the militants supported by notorious Pakistani intelligence has started brazen attacks on Hazara Shia community in Quetta. These fascistic and schaunistic Islamic militants have been emboldened and encouraged to the extent that they have already distributed night letters in Quetta preaching their philosophy of hatred by terming the Hazara Shias as Kafirs and has requested the residents of Quetta city to cooperate with them. What is astonishing here is that not even a single criminal has been apprehended and brought to justice yet and those who had been arrested earlier have been freed mysteriously. Knowing this Hazaras of Quetta are living a life constantly under the shadows of ? fear from target killing, suicide bombing and other sort of violance including possibilty of a near probable ethnic violance leading to a civil war in Balochistan already near to the breakup of Balochistan from Pakistan as result of decades old insurgency of Balochistan people. Question arises here is that why would Pakistani security agencies would want to support the islamic militants against the Hazara community despite the fact that Hazara community in Balochistan has rendered their valuable services to Pakistan Including Pakistan army ?and considered the only pro Pakistani local ethnic group in Balochistan until recently? The answer to this question needs a bit explanation of historical events in the region. Majority of Hazara intellectuals are of the view that the recent wave of violence perpetrated against Hazara community in Quetta has strong linkage with the events in Afghanistan. This needs little stress that ever since Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the subsequent backup of Americans Pakistanis left no stone unturned in promoting,nurturing and supporting of these Jihadis in the region throughout the period of Afghan Jihad and succeeding civil war in Afghanistan. Equally, Pakistan's role in creation and continued support of Taliban is crystal clear and needs no stress. Knowing this, Hazara intellectuals are cognizant enough of the of the double game being played by the notorious intelligence agency ISI in and around the region against NATO and Allied Forces after the fall of Taliban. Similarly as Hazaras being a member of Northern Alliance was one of the main hurdles in the way of hegemonic designs of Pakistan in Afghanistan throughout the decades of 90 due to the relentless support of Iran,India and Russia, that's why Pakistani security establishment began distrusting Hazara community in Quetta and continued to perceive them as security risk. Resultantly Hazara community in Quetta is continuously being harassed and terrorized by the stooges of it's security establishments so that they get migrate from here. Consequently Hazara community in Quetta continuously feel insecure and deeply distressed as they have been so marginalized to the extent that they feel themselves hostaged due to their unique Mongolian identity and facial features and their cohesive and exclusive settlements in Quetta city. What worries them most is that their offsprings can't go to schools,colleges and universities and their livelihood opportunities have have been decreased as a result of this organized violance. They don't have any surety of their lives when they leave their homes everyday as they are subjected to surreptitious, mysterious and organized state supported terrorism. Their only hope is from united nation and international community to take notice of their systematic genocide being carried out by Pakistani state and it's security organs. We desperately need your generous help. Save our souls.== Sources == 
[[Congressman Thad McCotter ends bid for U.S. president]]Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan notified the {w|The Detroit News} yesterday that he would end his long-shot {w|Thaddeus McCotter presidential campaign, 2012|campaign} for the {w|Republican Party|Republican Party}'s presidential nomination.  He threw his support behind former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.McCotter, who has represented {w|Michigan's 11th congressional district} since 2003, had announced his candidacy in early July. He reportedly paid $18,000 for campaign space at the {w|Ames Straw Poll} in August, but garnered only 35 votes and finished in last place at the event.  His campaign was unable to gain traction among the GOP base. He was excluded from all {w|Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|GOP presidential debates}, a fact he emphasized when arguing that his campaign's fate "was sort of death by media." Elaborating this point, he remarked "if they keep you out of the debates, you are out of the conversation and you can't run."McCotter decided to back Romney for president, believing he is the "most electable" GOP candidate because of his business background. Though he feels the current frontrunner, Texas governor {w|Rick Perry}, "may be a vice presidential nominee", he thinks the nation is not ready for another Texas governor to be president in the aftermath of the George W. Bush presidency. Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics applauded McCotter's decision, remarking "He really had no business running for president. If he wants to have any political future, endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do." His neighbor, former Michigan attorney general {w|Mike Cox}, commented "He tried it out, obviously it wasn't working. And he's doing the rational thing and dropping out."McCotter now plans to refocus his efforts on his re-election campaign for Congress. He is expected to face a primary challenge from State Senator Mike Kowall.

[[Thad McCotter]]I think it is fine to be pro-life and pro-rights. It's too bad pro-rights doesn't include supporting women's reproductive rights. It's too bad pro-life does not include opposing the death penalty.The Terri Schiavo case, when examined with the clarity of perfect hindsight, demonstrates clearly that those with a religious axe to grind are all too willing to interfere with sound medical judgment, and in the process deny the designated next-of-kin the RIGHT to decide, along with the doctors, an appropriate course of treatment for those who are vegetative with no hope of recovery. In the case of Schiavo, the parents were claiming responsiveness right before her death, yet autopsy showed dramatic and devastating brain degeneration which would have made such a thing completely impossible. Yet, the impassioned pleas of "right to lifers" across America prolonged this poor man's agony in a peculiarly selfish and self-aggrandizing way. In this case, the medical board has concluded that further care is a waste of time and resources. I don't think doctors, especially a whole panel of doctors, would so conclude unless they were very certain of their medical facts. The poor parents deserve our sympathy, but I for one cannot condone nor approve of the continuing abuse in the name of "right to life".

[[Fall yields a mixture of outcomes for many Texas lakes]]After suffering record-breaking drought conditions, many lakes in Texas are experiencing a wide array of results this Fall. Lake Texoma, which borders the area near the Texas - Oklahoma state boundary, experienced a rash of dead fish over the summer, after water temperatures reached a reported 90 degrees, and has most recently experienced a major blue-green algae outbreak, making the water off-limits to all swimmers. Two residents of Jacksonville told Wikinews on Saturday that dead fish carcasses still line much of the banks surrounding that lake, a scene they described as, "scary to see." That lake has only seen a rise of about 1-inch in water levels in recent days.Less than a week ago, authorities closed the last public boat ramp at Lake Travis, a popular public recreation site in Austin. Local news reports that lake's water levels are 33 feet below it's September average. Although a few fish survived, Lake Fairfield experienced a major fish kill earlier this month.== Sources ==

[[Oxfam report reveals over 20,000 were violently displaced in the name of climate change action]]Global relief and development organisation Oxfam has on Friday launched an appeal for the New Forests Company to investigate claims that over 20,000 Ugandans were violently evicted from their land in the name of climate change action.In a report released on Thursday titled ¡®Land and Power¡¯, Oxfam revealed that at least 22,500 Ugandan villagers have been displaced by violent evictions that involved the burning of houses and resulted in the death of an 8 year-old boy. The evictions were carried out as part of a deal that the NFC signed with the Ugandan National Forestry Authority in 2005 to develop 20,000 hectares of pine and eucalyptus plantations. The NFC, which promotes itself as a ¡®sustainable and socially responsible forestry company¡¯, is part-owned by the HSBC bank and its board of directors includes former managers of the Goldman Sachs Bank. The company has applied for carbon credits for carbon off-setting, and expects their forestry project to earn up to $1.8 million a year. The NFC claims the residents left voluntarily, and in a letter to Oxfam dated 9th September, 2011 stated ¡°there were no incidences of injury, physical violence or destruction of property during the voluntary vacation processes that have been brought to the attention of NFC¡±. Villagers claim that the violent evictions were carried out by the Ugandan authorities including police and military forces to make way for the NFC¡¯s plantations. Both the NFC and NFA have described the displaced groups as ¡®illegal encroachers and trespassers¡¯ who had settled on the land illegally. Despite a 2009 High Court issued injunction to stop the evictions pending a full hearing into the land rights of displaced citizens, local communities claim that the forcible removal of residents continued into mid-2010. The NFC claims that the injunction was wrongly issued to them, and allowed for the NFA to continue to carry out the evictions.The evictions have exacerbated the poverty of the former residents, who have had their homes and crops burnt. Many people have lost their means of providing food for their families and their source of income. To date, none of the evictees have received any compensation for their losses. The NFC have responded by calling Oxfam¡¯s report ¡°highly prejudicial¡± and have claimed that meticulous audits were carried out which proved the resettlements to be peaceful and voluntary. == Sources ==

[[Europe captures Solheim Cup after an epic battle]]European female professional golfers won the 12th staging of the Solheim Cup matches by beating Americans 15-13 on a rainy but otherwise dramatic and emotional Sunday. The competition was hosted on the Killeen Castle Golf Resort golf course over three days from 23rd to 25th of September 2011. Biennial Solheim Cup matches are played between teams of best U.S. born and European professional golfers since 1990. The Europeans won the Solheim Cup only three times before, in 1992, 2000, and 2003.After two days of the competition, which consisted of a total of two foursome and two fourball sessions, both teams have amassed 8 points each. This meant that the singles matches traditionally played on the final day would prove decisive.The tone of Sunday's matches was quickly set by an exceptional play of Scotland's Catriona Matthew who was paired against Paula Creamer. The American star, who was unbeaten during previous two days, was quickly loosing holes and after four Matthew was 3 up. Then the Scot won another with an eagle on the 7th. Creamer meanwhile bogeyed two following par fives, 10th and 12th, while Matthew parred them, and the match went to a dormie. As both players parred the following 13th Matthew won with a remarkable score of 6&5, equaling the highest defeat over an an American in singles Solheim Cup matches.The first point for the European team, however, was earned in an unlikely manner, as U.S. Cristie Kerr scheduled to play in the last pairing against England's Karen Stupples had to withdraw due to a right wrist injury. {QuoteRight|I¡¯m devastated that I couldn¡¯t play today to help represent my team, I tried my best but I couldn¡¯t hold the golf club.|source=Kerr's emotional comment on her withdrawal}Brittany Lang gave the first point for the Americans when she defeated German rookie Sandra Gal 6&5. Europe rebounded with a point from Sweden's Sophie Gustafson who won the second match of the day beating reigning Kraft Nabisco champion Stacy Lewis 2 up. Match no. 3 went in favour of Americans despite early lead by Anna Nordqvist of Sweden. After eigth holes Nordqvist was 2 up against Morgan Pressel but then the American won five consecutive holes. The Swede won one back at the 15th but could not deliver more and lost the match 2&1.The fourth match was being played between the oldest members of both teams - 51-year old Hall-of-Famer Juli Inkster and 47-year old England's legend Laura Davies. The American took the lead at the first hole and kept the advantage until 8th when Davies brought the match to all-square. Davies surged into the lead only after wining the 15th. The score held until they played the 18th, and when it looked as if the Europeans would earn another point Inkster won the last hole with a par after a poor shot from a greenside bunker by Davies and the half-points were shared between both teams.Things started to look dim for the Europeans after the U.S. team earned two more points from matches won by Christina Kim and rookie Vicky Hurst who defeated Sweden's Maria Hjorth and England's rookie Melissa Reid 4&2 and 2 up, respectively, and the Americans took the lead for the first time on Sunday.An unlikely point to level the score was won for the European's by Christel Boeljon - a rookie and the first Dutch player to compete in the Solheim Cup matches. Boeljon, the shortest hitter among all players, was paired against the long-hitting american star Brittany Lincicome. Boeljon led from the early holes and closed the match with a fine birdie at the last to win 2 up.At that point there were three matches still being played and the Europeans weren't leading any of them, with the projected scores in favour of the Americans.Europe's highest ranked player Norway's Suzann Pettersen was playing against Michell Wie, being 1 down after 15 holes. The she delivered a spectacular display of skills birdieing three remaining holes for a 1 up victory and another point for her team.In the other match there two rookies paired - Sweden's Caroline Hedwall and U.S. captain's pick Ryan O'Toole, the latter having a perfect 4-0-0 record set in the previous days' matches. With two holes remaining Hedwall was 2 down, but at the 17th her par was good enough to win against O'Toole's bogey to bring the score to 1 down. In the match which followed them Spain's Azahara Mu?oz - another European rookie - won the 17th after a close approach to the green and a holed birdie putt to go 1 up against Angela Stanford. With that she secured at least a half point for her team.As the Europeans needed 14.5 point to win the trophy this meant that Hedwall had to win her last hole to bring her match to an even score. The Swede hit her approach shot into a birdie distance from the flag, while her american oponnent made another unlikely error landing her second shot in the rough left of the green and then leaving her chip short of the putting surface. O'Toole conceded the hole what sparked european celebrations, as that gave them enough points to win the Solheim Cup trophy. The last match was won by the Spaniard setting the final score at 15 to 13 for the Europeans.== Sources == 
[[Delhi earns UN carbon credits]]The UN has certified that the Delhi {w|Delhi Metro|Metro} has aided in the reduction of {w|greenhouse gases}, earning 'carbon credits'.  This makes the Delhi Metro the first of its kind in the world to do so.This comes under the {w|Clean Development Mechanism} of the UN under the {w|Kyoto Protocol}. The UN said the rail based system has helped to save 630,000 tonnes of {w|pollution} a year. The credits to the {w|Delhi Metro Rail Corporation} are worth $9.5 million for each of the next seven years.  More credits would be given for more passengers on the system.The credits are designed as a financial incentive for {w|developing countries} to reduce greenhouse emissions.The Delhi Metro was started in 2002. According to the DMRC, it has reduced road traffic by more than 91,000 vehicles per day.

[[Occupy Wall St Protest Continues]]The protest, labeled "Occupy Wall St." has lead 1,000s on an agenda to call out the bankers, government, and other various corporations on corruption. Streaming live, a camera crew walks around capturing the event for the entire world to see. Videos, and pictures from multiple people have been spread throughout the web community displaying the movement, cheers, meetings, and police officers' actions against some of the protesters.It's been reported that at least 80 people were arrested. One for reportedly taking photographs of the scene, and some for wearing masks. While it's apparent that many of the protesters are calm and peaceful, police officers still aimed to use excessive force.An incident has been recorded of women being maced by an officer that was walking by. Other videos followed with officers dragging, and pinning down various protesters. A couple of people were being searched unlawfully for unknown reasons. A woman was initiating legal representation via National Laywers Guild for another incident. The protesters' top agenda is to draw attention to the corruption by corporations in America. Not only are they protesting over America's debt situation, but health care and the way the government feeds into corporation greed.Protesters frequently have meetings, training, and discuss other topics covering the current events. Following shortly after protesting, a public petition at the White House website was created. This Petition is to recognize the men and women who are protesting against Wall Street. On the evening of September 24, 2011, many people in the live stream channel collaborated on calling various media organisations and encouraging them to report on Occupy Wall St.. Apparently successful, ABC News, MSNBC, and NBC New York followed up with reports. The articles are now appearing to be updated since the the 24th.

After three violations of the conditions, he would be jailed.He had recently travelled to and from {w|Warsaw} just before the order came, because he anticipated some travel restrictions.== Sources == 
[[Australian columnist 'offended, insulted, humiliated' fair-skinned Aborigines]]Conservative commentator {w|Andrew Bolt} has been found in breach of the {w|Racial Discrimination Act}, following a pair of newspaper articles in 2009 where Bolt criticised fair-skinned people identifying as Aborigines.Australia's {w|Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court} Justice Mordecai Bromberg said "I am satisfied that fair-skinned Aboriginal people were reasonably likely ... to have been offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated by the imputations conveyed by the newspaper articles," Justice Bromberg said. "People should be free to fully identify with their race without fear of public disdain or loss of esteem for so identifying."The articles, titled "It's so hip to be black" and "White fellas in the black", were published by the {w|Herald Sun} and Weekly Times in 2009, in addition to two blog posts published on the Herald Sun's website.The nine plaintiffs were jubilant following delivery of the verdict. Taking legal action against Mr Bolt were former ATSIC member {w|Geoff Clark|Geoff Clark}, academic {w|Larissa Behrendt}, native title expert Graham Atkinson, academic Wayne Atkinson, lawyer Mark McMillan, activist Pat Eatock and artist Bindi Cole. They argued Bolt's articles offended, upset and demeaned them while implying they identified as Aboriginal Australians for personal gain.Bolt's lawyer, Neil Young, argued in court that the articles were a genuine reflection of his client's beliefs and were published in the public interest. "Everything that's said, even if it's expressed colourfully, is rationally related to a thesis that's a matter of public interest," Mr Young had said.Bolt said his writings were fair and within the provisions of free speech laws. Ron Merkel, QC, for the complainants, said his clients did not target free speech, stating that while Bolt is free to express his views, he should not have attacked the nine individuals named in the articles.Justice Bromberg told the court Bolt's articles would have offended a reasonable member of the Aboriginal community, adding that the articles were factually incorrect and not written with good faith. "I am satisfied that each of Mr Bolt and the Herald & Weekly Times engaged in conduct which contravened section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act."Bolt described the verdict as "a terrible day for free speech in this country," adding "It is particularly a restriction on the freedom of all Australians to discuss multiculturalism and how people identify themselves,"Ms Eatock, a prominent activist and the chief plaintiff, said she was not confident of receiving an apology from Mr Bolt. "I will never get an apology from Mr Bolt. He made that clear giving his evidence earlier in the year," she said. "But we will, I hope, get some sort of acknowledgment through the press that what he wrote was just unacceptable, totally unacceptable. He set out to offend from the word go and in fact he acknowledged that in his evidence."== Sources == 
[[Australian media inquiry suggests new press tribunal]]The Australian media could be subject to a new legal tribunal after suggestions the current regulatory body, the Australian Press Council, should be replaced.The issue, raised in a paper released on Wednesday, called for comment regarding whether the press should be subject to a new set of laws under the tribunal. The move is part of an official media inquiry currently being held by the Federal Government. Primary backer of the inquiry, Senator Stephen Conroy, believes the industry driven Australian Press Council does not have enough power to properly regulate the media."The press council has been considered right across the board as a toothless tiger," he said. The new tribunal would have the power to request information from the media. Strict sanctions could be subsequently imposed by the body if outlets failed to act accordingly. The government inquiry also included suggestions to ban sourcing material through 'unfair means' and enforcing the public notification of any instance where payments for information were made.Questions regarding common regulation for print, broadcast and online media were also raised in the paper which states, ¡°Is there any reason why the regulation of the print media should be different from the regulation of broadcast or online media?¡± However, critics of the inquiry believe increased control of the media in Australia would create oppression and breach the basic human right of free speech. The government inquiry continues. == Sources == 
[[UK Phone Hacking Inquiry lacks Journalist Representation]]The Inquiry into the UK Phone Hacking Scandal has been challenged by leading British newspapers, with concerns that the six-strong Advisory Panel lacks tabloid and regional newspaper experience.Associated News, Trinity Mirror and Guardian News and Media have asked for additional 'assessors' to advise Lord Justice Leveson on the intricacies of the British Media.Jonathon Caplan QC, representing Associated Newspapers told the hearing that the inquiry issued by Prime Minister David Cameron in July, "raises very important issues for the future conduct, regulation and ownership of the newspaper industry."Only three have some newspaper experience and none are representative of the tabloid or mid-market newspapers, or have had experience of national newspaper production at a senior management or editorial level."Caplan reiterated "we [Associated News] do not wish to be confrontational."Gill Phillips of Guardian News and Media said to the judge: "we believe it is neccesary the assistance to your inquiry reflects the plurality and divergence of the press."Lord Justice Leveson has intended to reserve his judgement on the case, but has accepted his lack of knowledge of the journalism industry and has welcomed all advice."I am very conscious that I am stepping into a profession that is not the one that I spent 40 years of my life in", he said. "It is critically important through this inquiry I have the help of everyone."The Leveson Inquiry is to have far-reaching impacts on the British press, with a free press considered a vital component in a democratic society.Labour MP Ivan Lewis sparked controversy yesterday with calls to 'strike off' journalists guilty of malpractice, limiting the range of the free press."If it was found that individuals appeared to behave in a way that was gross malpractice it seems to me that the industry should want to do something about that" Mr Lewis said.Users of Twitter likened the idea of licensing journalists to the way journalists were administrated by Mussolini in fascist Italy in 1925.Roy Greenslade of The Guardian compared this to Zimbabwe, Bahrain and Kazakhstan, who each suffer oppressive regimes and a restriction of their press."What we require is a constructive and sensible debate, not a ridiculous gallery-pleasing speech that threatens the freedoms fought down four centuries" Mr Greenslade said.The Inquiry was set up by Prime Minister David Cameron after public outrage regarding the hacking of murdered Surrey school-girl Milly Dowler's phone, which unravelled a web of phone hacking within the UK, sparking international interest.== Sources ==

[[New Brunswick experiences widespread phone outages]]Many parts of the Canadian province of New Brunswick experienced phone outages yesterday when circuits operated by incumbent carrier Bell Aliant seemed to fail due to a reported fibre line cut in the northern part of the province.Services impacted reportedly included cellular and wireline telephone calls, debit and credit card payment transactions along with some internet access.  Impact to emergency service numbers such as 911 was unknown, but Bell Aliant had said that they kept the New Brunswick Department of Public Safety informed throughout the outage.Customers of Rogers Communications, the regional cable provider, have reported no issues calling within the Rogers network, but have encountered intermittent difficulty with inter-carrier calls or calls to cellular devices, as these must be routed through the network operated by Bell Aliant.In an emailed statement, Bell Aliant indicates that the intermittent service issues were due in part to an unforeseen error in the switchover to their backup system, but that service has been restored and the cause of the error in the changeover is under investigation.== Sources == 
[['Fascinating' and 'provocative' research examines genetic elements of bipolar, schizophrenia]]Last week, {W|Nature Genetics} carried twin studies into the genetics of {W|bipolar disorder} and {W|schizophrenia}. This special report examines the month's research into the illnesses in detail, with Wikinews obtaining comment from experts based in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom ahead of the U.S. {W|Mental Illness Awareness Week}, which starts tomorrow.Eleven genetic regions were identified; seven of these were for schizophrenia and five of those were hitherto undiscovered. The parallel studies, conducted separately, examined more than 50,000 people worldwide and identified two {W|Locus|genetic loci} associated with both diseases.Little is known about the two illnesses, each of which affects around 1% of people and is treated with strong medication. Bipolar sufferers experience extremes of mood ¨C depression and mania, hence the previous name ¡°manic depression¡± for the illness. Schizophrenia is associated with hearing voices, chaotic thoughts, and paranoia. There is no known cure.The latest research examined both the healthy and the afflicted, using computers to scan genomes. Inheritance was thought to be a factor from prior knowledge of the diseases as a familial trait, but the original desire had been to isolate a single faulty gene. Instead it has become apparent that the genetic factors are many; in the case of schizophrenia, at most around 30% of the genetic components are thought to have been identified.The {W|University of Chicago}¡¯s Pablo Gejman, a lead researcher on the schizophrenia study, explained to Wikinews in a telephone interview from {W|Buenos Aires}, Argentina that ¡°One of the goals of genetic research is to find druggable targets¡± ¨C to ¡°find treatments at the root of the problem¡±.Whilst noting that there is no guarantee the genetic code identified is druggable, Gejman named calcium-activated neurochemical channels in the brain as candidates for new drugs. The channels were linked to schizophrenia in the study.Gejman explained that a genetic locus called mir137 ¡°suggests an abnormality of gene regulation.¡± The diseases are so poorly understood that it is uncertain if they are in fact two components of a single spectrum, or even each comprised of multiple illnesses. The new and ¡°provocative data¡± gathered showed the significant loci identified were ¡°not part of the pre-existent hypothesis.¡± Calling this ¡°interesting¡±, Gejman added that the team found  no evidence that {W|dopamine} receptors are involved; current drug treatments target dopamine receptors. The findings are ¡°not related to anything we thought we knew [about schizophrenia],¡± he told our correspondent.Quizzed about the possibility variations in the genetic factors involved in expressing the diseases explained the variation seen in symptoms, Gejman was uncertain. ¡°We will have the answer, probably, only when we sequence the whole [human] {W|genome}.¡± He notes that the relationship between genotype and phenotype is unclear, and that ¡°We know very little of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and¡± other disorders. At the time the results were published, participating scientist Professor Rodney Scott from the University of Newcastle in Australia said ¡°The strength of this research is in the numbers. The findings are robust and give us a lot of statistical power to identify the genetic determinants of schizophrenia.¡± Scott told Wikinews that ¡°If any single centre tried to undertake such a study, it would require millions of pounds. Since it was a collection of data from across the world the costs were spread. In this era of financial difficulty it will become increasingly difficult to secure funding for this type of project even though the pay-offs will be significant.¡±Gejman expressed similar sentiment. ¡°The research budget is not growing, which makes [funding] difficult,¡± he said, though he felt the cost ¡°is not prohibitive because of the benefits.¡± ¡°I think that it was money well invested¡± and ¡°very well spent for the future,¡± he said, adding that organisations in Europe and the US were aware of the importance of such research. Gejman also agreed on reliability ¨C the study is ¡°Very reliable because of the sample size; that should provide robust results¡­ [we] have worked with a much larger sample than before.¡± Scott told us it was ¡°a highly reliable study¡± that has the potential to lead to new treatments ¡°in the long run¡±.Another point was the two genetic loci identified as common to both ¨C how much support do they lend to the notion the diseases are linked? ¡°Until more information is available it is really only suggestive,¡± says Scott. ¡°Strong enough to say there may be potentially a common pathway that bifurcates to give rise to two diseases.¡±¡°It is an excellent demonstration,¡± said Gejman ¡°because you have the same chains that are common to both disorders, in fact not just the same chains but also the same {W|allele}s.¡± He stressed uncertainty in how strong the relationship was, however. Scott said examining how the variation of genetic factors may translate into varied symptoms being expressed ¡°certainly is a good target for future research¡±; ¡°It is not known how many genetic factors contribute to either of these diseases but it is likely that not all are necessary to trigger disease.¡± ¡°New questions will always arise from any major study,¡± he told our reporter. ¡°Certainly, new questions about bipolar and schizophrenia are now able to be formulated on the basis of the results presented in the two reports.¡±These weren¡¯t the only studies to look at the two diseases together in September. The {W|British Medical Journal} carried research by a team from the University of Oxford and {W|King's College London} that examined mortality rates in England for schizophrenia and bipolar sufferers. They found both groups continued to suffer higher mortality rates than the general population ¨C whilst these included suicides, three quarters of deaths were down to ailments such a s heart conditions. General death rates dropped from 1999 to 2006, but sufferers below 65 saw their death rate remain stable ¨C and the over-65 saw theirs increase."By 2006, the excess risk in these groups had risk to twice the rate of the general population, whereas prior to that it had only been 1.6 times the risk, so it increased by almost 40%," said Dr Uy Hoang of Oxford. The study looked at every discharged inpatient with a diagnosis of either condition in England in the relevant time.Hoang said at the time of the research¡¯s release that doctors should devote attention to predicting and preventing physical illness associated with mental disorders. His study comes at a time when the UK has launched a "no health without mental health" strategy which does attempt to screen for physical illnesses coinciding with mental illnesses. The government aims to reduce the death rate of those with mental disorders.Rodney Scott described this research result to Wikinews as ¡°Possibly¡± connected to genetic association with other hereditary ailments, such as cardiovascular disease; he told us another possibility is that ¡°The continued raised mortality rates may be associated with the diseases themselves.¡± ¡°We believe the NHS [{W|National Health Service}] and Department of Health need to do more to support research and service development for people with bipolar disorder,¡± Wikinews was told by Suzanne Hudson, Chief Executive of London-based British charity MDF The Bipolar Organisation. ¡°The provision of specialist services for bipolar is very limited in the UK and the demand for our services is unprecedented.¡±¡°A genetic test for bipolar would be a useful tool but the science and ethics are very complex,¡± Hudson told us, referring to the Nature Genetics genetic study. ¡°Just because someone has 'bipolar genes' does not mean they might go on to develop it.  Family studies of bipolar show that this is a likely outcome of genetics research in this area.  Even if it were possible to accurately predict bipolar in this way, questions about how you treat that person are difficult.  For example do you start medication that is not necessary at that point in time?¡±¡°Current treatment is not satisfactory¡± because it does not always work and has ¡°side effects,¡± Gejman told us. Robert Whitaker, a US medical journalist and book author, told an audience in New Zealand at the end of August that evidence suggests antidepressant drugs may make children and teenagers worse ¨C ¡°You see many become worse and end up with a more severe diagnosis, like bipolar illness," and the suicide risk may increase. Whitaker blames commercial interests. "The adult market appeared saturated, and so they began eying children and teenagers. Prior to this, few children and youth were seen as suffering from major depression, and so few were prescribed anti-depressants."One possible alternative, raised by a connection between depressive illness and inflammation, is aspirin and similar compounds. ¡°The link between inflammation and mood disorders has been known for sometime and the use of aspirin and other drugs in depression is now becoming more common in the literature,¡± Hudson says. ¡°Any new treatments for bipolar, which is a very complex and {W|co-morbid} illness, has to be a good thing.¡± Professor Dr. Michael Berk, chairman of psychiatry at Australia¡¯s {W|Deakin University}, recently gave a talk to just this effect. Speaking at this year¡¯s Congress of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, held this past month, he also highlighted {W|statin}s as a treatment. Recognising the link to physical ailments, he told an interviewer "The brain does not exist in isolation, and we need to understand that pathways similar to those that underpin risks for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and osteoporosis might also underpin the risk for psychiatric disorders, and that other treatments might be helpful."Berk also touched upon speed of diagnosis and treatment; "Early interventions can potentially improve the outcome" of bipolar sufferers, he told his audience. MDF The Bipolar Organisation claim an average of ten years is possible before a person is diagnosed. ¡°This clearly is an issue,  if we believe that earlier diagnosis and treatment facilitate better outcomes,¡± Berk told Wikinews. Though he questions the effectiveness of currently-used drugs on advanced bipolar cases, he does not go so far as to say drugs are actively harmful. He told us ¡°it appears that our best treatments work best earlier in the illness course; and that seems to apply to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.¡±Berk has already performed research using statins which suggests they can form a treatment. He now seeks funding for research involving aspirin. On funding, he tells Wikinews ¡°psychiatric disorders comprise between 16% and 22% of the burden of disability, attracts[sic] just over 6% of the clinical budget at least in Australia and 3% of the research budget. Research as a discretionary spending item is at great risk.¡±Berk¡¯s research, in the past, has been funded by companies including {W|GlaxoSmithKline}. Hudson told Wikinews this did not concern her charity; in fact, they welcomed it. ¡°We believe it is important pharmaceutical companies continue to invest in the development of new medications for bipolar. This is how it works in all other health specialities and mental health should be no different.¡±¡°There is a need for greater education for mental health professionals and GPs [general practitioners] about bipolar [in the UK],¡± she told us. ¡°As the national bipolar charity we receive many, many calls and requests from GPs and other health professionals for our leaflets and information sheets which is fantastic.  We very much welcome opportunities to work together for the benefit of individuals affected by bipolar.¡±Wikinews contacted the UK¡¯s {W|National Institute for Clinical Excellence} to discuss issues raised in this article, including future treatments, genetic screening, and mortality rates. NICE did not respond.Might statins and/or aspirin improve treatment ¨C might they be cheaper, perhaps, or safer? ¡°This is an area of research promise,¡± says Berk, ¡°however it is too early to make any clinical treatment claims; [all] we can say is that this needs to be studied in properly designed trials capable of giving a more definitive answer.¡± And what of possible explanations for the increased mortality rate observed in England? Should researchers look at whether bipolar influences more than just the brain, or if it is linked to other genetic conditions? ¡°For sure,¡± he told us. ¡°There is new evidence that similar pathways contribute to the risk for both medical and psychiatric illness, both in terms of lifestyle factors, and biomarkers of risk.¡±== Sources == 
[[NATO won't comply with federal court]]NATO said it will not comply with a federal court ruling that says American civilians retain their constitutional rights while working in Afghanistan and Iraq with the US military.U.S. District Judge James Gwin ruled that American rights ¡°cuts strongly in favor¡± of granting ¡°constitutional protection overseas.¡± This ruling is from the case of John Doe vs. Donald Rumsfeld, where the court found that ¡°even in times of war, [that] does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties.¡±But after careful review of the August ruling, NATO decided not to comply with the D.C. court opinion. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the opinion that American citizens carry their constitutional rights abroad while in the care of the U.S government in the case of Vance vs. Rumsfeld.Even with the court's affirmation, NATO declined to alter its stance. ¡°There is no change to the NATO position,¡± said in an email Col. Gregory Julian, chief of public affairs for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, with NATO.NATO ruled last year that the US Constitution, federal law and Supreme Court rulings are ¡°not relevant¡± in Afghanistan and Iraq.      This legal stance from NATO headquarters in Belgium brought swift opposition in America.¡°For NATO to say that the United States Constitution does not apply in Afghanistan is ridiculous,¡± said R. Tamara de Silva, a Chicago lawyer specializing in federal civil rights. ¡°American troops do not fight under a foreign flag. They fight under the United States flag,¡± de Silva said.In essence, the court¡¯s 47-page ruling boils down to this. ¡°You don¡¯t check your civil liberties when you leave the boundaries of the United States,¡± said de Silva.The new federal ruling gives enormous civil-rights protections for the thousands of American contractors and journalists working with the US military in the Middle East.But NATO said it not obliged to conduct a standard hearing before it sends any American packing. That is in contrast to US law. In 1970 the Supreme Court laid out the bare bones for a ¡°meaningful hearing¡± in Goldberg vs. Kelly and said all defendants in civil cases must be granted this.But NATO called these minimum mandates ¡°too exhaustive.¡± And they said they will not comply with the Supreme Court, either.Upon hearing this defiance, a congressman promptly wrote NATO strongly suggesting they reconsider. Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy, a former prosecutor, said he was ¡°sensitive¡± to the Constitution and displeased if reporters were ¡°hastily terminated¡± and not given ¡°meaningful hearing or opportunity for a proper defense.¡±NATO replied and declined the congressional request.Why would NATO take such an obstinate position? One reason could be diversion.¡°The reason they don¡¯t want to have due process is because they don¡¯t want to have scrutiny on their procedures,¡± said Charles Gittins, former Marine Corps JAG officer and military law expert who defended the commander in the Tailhook case. ¡°The military has a long history of believing they are above the law. I mean they do things all the time that are unlawful.¡±NATO¡¯s position on civil rights seems to add to the eroding confidence Americans have regarding the war in Afghanistan. This summer, 79 percent of Americans supported President Obama¡¯s plan of getting out of there, according to a CBS poll. Last summer a CBS poll showed 62 percent of Americans thought the war was going badly.¡°I think we need to reevaluate our relationship with NATO,¡± said Charles Swift, former Navy JAG lieutenant commander who won the Supreme Court case regarding Osama bin Laden¡¯s driver¡ªand who¡¯s Navy career then quickly ended.== Sources == This is original reporting and quotes/sources:Charles Swift¡ªhttp://www.prolegaldefense.com/charles.php.

[[First ever rally for scientific life extension]]Saturday, September 24, 2011 a first rally for scientific radical life extension took place in Moscow, Russia.The supporters of scientific progress met on the Revolution Square in Moscow, Russia on September 24, 2011 to proclaim that radical human life extension became a necessity. They stated that research in this sphere should be done rapidly and effectively and   that refuse talking on this topic or joke on it are the crimes.Actually, 150 thousand people die every day from age related diseases, much more people are becomming disabled daily and most of people  got used to it and think about it as a normal practice and do nothing to stop it. Recent scientific successes in rejuvenation and extending a lifespan of  model animals and discovery of variety of animals having {w | negligible senescence |negligible senescence }  give hope to achieve negligible senescence for humans, reverse it or at least significantly delay it. But most of the people don't actively support this effort, they even don't know that the struggle against death is under way. The time have changed, it was unbelievable in the past, but science is boosting and now life extension supporters  want to be heard. The activists claim that most of scientists are making the research they are being paid for by grants. That's why it is very important to induce a demand of the governments and society to order such kind of research. This is a first event of such kind. It was organised by Russian  {w | Transhumanism |Transhumanism } Movement, a leading Russian non-profit organisation supporting technological progress in enhancing abilities of the humans.  The member of RTM coordinate council  {w | Danila Medvedev |Danila Medvedev } stated that the event will open the new stage of the uncompromising fight against death for life. He noted that a fundamental human right a Right to Life is declared almost in all basic documents from  {w | Universal Declaration of Human Rights |Universal Declaration of Human Rights } to national constitutions, but now it is not backed by the real efforts of governments and public.

[[Australian news network under investigation over pokie reform comments]]The {w|Australian Communications and Media Authority} has launched an investigation into the {w|Nine Network} over comments by its football commentators regarding the government's planned poker machine reform.An ACMA statement yesterday read: "ACMA has confirmed that it is investigating a complaint that Channel Nine broadcast political material without adequately identifying it as such during the NRL first preliminary final".The comments, made during an {w|NRL} football match on September 23, saw Nine¡¯s commentators {w|Ray Warren} and {w|Phil Gould} criticizing the reforms, labeling pokie reform as "rubbish". Mr Gould added "I¡¯ve never seen a more stupid policy in all my life."Networks are required to acknowledge political comment when broadcast as a condition of their licenses. "The identification of political material usually takes the form of a statement following the material advising on whose behalf the material had been broadcast", the ACMA statement noted.Proposed reforms to poker machines will see gamblers forced to pre-commit to a limit on their losses, or instead use low-intensity poker machines with $1 bets.Shelly Bates, Nine Network¡¯s compliance manager, claimed, as reported by {w|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC}¡¯s {w|Media Watch|Media Watch}, "The comments relating to the Federal Government proposed poker machine tax were purely the opinions of the commentators regarding matters directly affecting the NRL community".  Mr Warren previously told {w|Austereo}¡¯s {w|Triple M} that the comments were "a directive from up top ... [to] be read by at least somebody" adding,  "I think it was done on behalf of the [National] Rugby League, who is fully supportive of the clubs."On Monday, independents in the {w|Australian Parliament} {w|Andrew Wilkie} and {w|Nick Xenophon} wrote to {w|David Gyngell}, chief executive of the Nine Network, accusing the network of "attempting to mislead viewers", and of breaching the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, the Broadcasting Services Act, and the Electoral Act. Nine responded with a statement yesterday, "The Nine Network will be providing Messrs Wilkie and Xenophon with a detailed and considered response on the issues they have raised, and we are confident we are not in breach of any code provisions."If ACMA rules Nine in breach of its license conditions the watchdog may impose a fine or further license conditions, demand action to prevent further breaches, or even suspend or cancel the network's license.== Sources ==

[[Italian Wikipedia strikes]]Italian Wikipedia is striking against the paragraph 29 of the so called "DDL intercettazioni". This bill, at the time being debated in the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian parliament, is thought of as being the origin of severe limitations to the freedom of editing in the "horizontal" manner which is common to the Wikimedia projects.The content is hidden by CSS and everyone is redirected to the Italian version of the announcement.The open letter, published on the 4th of October in the Italian language Wikipedia and addressed to the readers, stated: After the draft bill has been kept on hold in parliament for more than a year, the government has now revived it to discuss an amendment, insisting that the restrictions on the media and websites are needed to ensure the rights of private citizens.This privacy law, dubbed "Wiretapping Act" or "Gag Law", would impose severe restriction on Italian newspapers' and internet pages' right to publish police wiretaps during preliminary investigations, and which may eventually result in a shutdown of www.wikipedia.it permanently because of provisions in the law that oblige websites to correct content deemed harmful or biased within 48 hours of a complaint, with no right of appeal.The protesters and opponents of the wiretapping law accuse the government of scrambling to cover up corruption with laws that threaten basic freedom of expression.The Italian language Wikipedia site is its fourth-largest, with more than over 800,000 articles and over 600,000 registered users. In the two days the protest statement was up, it was viewed 16 million times.== Sources == 
[[Nobel Prize awarded to dead scientist]]A Canadian scientist has died, days before he received the Nobel Prize in medicine for his research on the body¡¯s immune system.Dr. Ralph Steinman, 68, died on Friday after a four-year struggle against pancreatic cancer. He had been treating himself with a form of immunotherapy based on his own discoveries. The rules state that the Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless the winner dies between the date of the announcement and the awards ceremony. However, following an emergency meeting, the Nobel Foundation announced the decision would remain unchanged despite Steinman¡¯s death. ¡°The Nobel prize to Ralph Steinman was made in good faith, based on the assumption that the Nobel laureate was alive,¡± said the Nobel Foundation. Ann-Marie Dumanski, of the Nobel Assembly in Stockholm, said it was ¡°the first time [the assembly] have had to deal with such a situation,¡± as the death of a winner days before the announcement, and unknown to the assembly, was unprecedented.This year¡¯s Nobel Prize for Medicine was given to three scientists, for their pioneering work on the immune system. French biologist Jules Hoffmann, 70, and American Bruce Beautler, 53, will share half of the 10 million Swedish kronor prize money, with the remainder intended for Steinman, though the unusual circumstances leave its fate in doubt.Steinman had been affiliated with Rockefeller University in New York since 1970, and headed its Center for Immunology and Immune Diseases. ¡°We are all so touched that our father¡¯s many years of hard work are being recognized with a Nobel Prize. He devoted his life to his work and his family, and he would be truly honored,¡± Alexis Steinman, Steinman¡¯s daughter, said in the Rockefeller University statement. == Sources == 
[[South African parliament questioned over media policy]]Parliamentary media policy in South Africa will be subject to legal advice after complaints journalists have a lack of freedom in reporting government proceedings. The move follows a call to ban journalist Deon de Lange from reporting on parliament, after he allegedly breached reporting protocol by speaking to a parliament official without permission. De Lange quoted the unnamed official who criticised a push to pass the Protection of State Information Bill, which would ban whistle-blowing on classified documents. The editor of Independent Newspapers, de Lange's employer, has stated he was unaware of the parliamentary media rule. Other media groups, including the National Press Club and the Cape Town Press Club believe the move to ban De Lange is "ridiculous" according to Eye Witness News, also saying they were unaware of the rule. Both clubs have condemned the move. No issues were raised regarding journalists quoting parliamentarians previously. The parliamentary media policy was reviewed in 2009 unbeknown to many press outlets.Opposition parliamentary leader Atholl Trollip believes the move is being used to further gag the media from reporting on parliament, however parliamentary spokesman Luzuko Jacobs has stated that officials need to remain neutral in their stance on issues. "It is unethical, unacceptable and we can't have officials expressing a negative or a positive comment," he said. Jacobs has refuted the claims South African media is being refused reporting rights; the government does not intend to make it impossible for journalists to speak with members of parliament through the media policy, he says. == Sources ==

[[WHY DOES INDIAN GOVERNMENT CONCEAL POVERTY FACTS? WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING FACTORS?]]Delete this line, and start typing your article in its placeAccording to World Bank estimates, 80 per cent of India's population lives on less than $2 a day. The Gross Domestic Product of the 41 heavily indebted poor countries is less than the combined wealth of the world's 7 richest people! In 2005, the wealthiest 20 per cent of the world accounted for 76.6 per cent of total private consumption. Most of the decrease in hunger levels was in Asia, with 80 million fewer hungry, but progress was also made in sub-Saharan Africa, where 12 million fewer people are going hungry.Every third Indian is living below the poverty line, estimates an expert group saying that more than 37 per cent of people are poor, ten per cent more than estimated earlier. Among the states, Orissa and Bihar are at the bottom, while Nagaland, Delhi and J&K have the least number of poor, says a report by the expert group, headed by Suresh Tendulkar, former chairman of PM¡¯s Economic Advisory Council. As much as 41.8 per cent of the rural population survive with monthly per capita consumption expenditure of Rs. 447, in other others they spend only Rs. 447 on essential necessities like food, fuel, light, clothing and footwear. Among the urban population, 25.7 per cent are poor, spending Rs. 578.8 on essential needs. It was set up in the wake of growing criticism of the existing official estimates of poverty released by the Planning Commission in 2007.However, the number of hungry people is higher in 2010 than before the food and economic crises of 2008 09.The percentage of Americans struggling below the poverty line in 2009 was the highest in 15 years. Four million additional Americans found themselves in poverty in 2009, with the total reaching 44 million.Children are the most visible victims of under-nutrition. Children who are poorly nourished suffer up to 160 days of illness each year. Poor nutrition plays a role in at least half of the 10.9 million child deaths each year - five million deathsIndia accounts for 50 per cent of the worlds hungry. Over 46 per cent of Indian children are undernourished. Health too is a major challenge - the very survival of India's women and children is threatened. In 2006, on average 254 women died giving birth to a child for every 100,000 live births down from 327 in 1990. Across India 74 children died before they reached the age of five for every 1,000 live births in 2005-06 as compared to 125 in 1990. India has been ranked 67, way below neighboring countries like China and Pakistan, in a new Global Hunger Index by the International Food Policy Research Institute. The number of poor in 2015 is likely to be 279 million at all-India level. China has made considerable progress in fighting poverty and especially hunger. In 2008, it stood at the 15th spot with a hunger rate of 7.1 points. In 2009, it jumped up to the 5th position with a hunger rate of 5.7, even though it has a huge population. However, this year, it ranked 9th in the index. The world produces enough food to feed everyone. World agriculture produces 17 per cent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 per cent population increase. This is enough to provide everyone in the world with at least 2,720 kilocalories per person per day. The main problem is that many people in the world do not have sufficient land to grow, or income to purchase, enough food. Malnutrition affects 32.5 per cent of children in developing countries. More than 70 per cent of malnourished children live in Asia, 26 per cent in Africa and 4 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean.  1.3 Stylized Facts of Indian Poverty 2011
[[Bishop Desmond Tutu criticises government for blocking Dalai Lama¡¯s entry]]The South African government has been accused of intentionally blocking his entry into the country by dragging its feet in granting him a visa. The South African government denies caving into pressure from {w|Beijing} to block the Dalai Lama, stating instead that they have not received any visa applications from the Dalai Lama.  Both the Dalai Lama's staff and Tutu's staff as well as the event organisers deny this, stating they had begun the visa process in June and have repeatedly submitted a number of applications and followed up on a daily basis.  This has unleashed a torrent of criticisms directed at the South African government from a wide cross-section of South African society that the ruling {w|African National Congress} government was caving into pressure from the {w|People's Republic of China} so as to protect the country's growing trade and investment interests with China. Leader of the opposition {w|Helen Zille} and civil society leader {w|Mamphela Ramphele} stated that the ANC government was "betraying South Africa's sovereignty and Constitution." The ANC government's {w|COSATU} allies also criticised the move with COSATU's {w|Western Cape} leader {w|Tony Ehrenreich} stating that South Africa "should not exchange our morality for dollars or yuan."  High ranking ANC members {w|Ahmed Kathrada} and {w|Barbara Hogan} jointly stated that: "Today all freedom-loving South Africans bow their heads in shame at the brazen insult thrown at two Nobel Peace Prize laureates."South African Deputy President {w|Kgalema Motlanthe} tried to mitigate criticism of the government by stating after the Dalai Lama had cancelled his trip that it was ready to grant the Dalai Lama a visa. A visibly angry Tutu responded to Mptlanthe's statement to the government's response by stating that the ANC government was "worse than the apartheid government" and threatened to pry for the ANC government's removal from power.  Warning that even though the {w|North African} governments of {w|Mubarak} and {w|Gaddafi} had 'a large majority' they to had lost power and that the current government had better "watch out."Other commentators have noted that given South Africa's current economic situation in which job creation and economic growth has become such a high priority it would be foolish for South Africa to risk its trade relations with its largest trading partner over issuing a visa to one person. A few days before the Dalai Lama cancelled his trip to the country, South Africa and China signed a US$2.5 billion deal between the {w|China Development Bank} and the {w|Development Bank of South Africa}.This is not the first time {w|People's Republic of China ¨C South Africa relations} have been accused of complicating the Dalai Lama's attempts to enter South Africa. In 2009 the Dalai Lama was denied entry into South Africa on the eve of the {w|2010 Soccer World Cup}.  Before 2009 the Dalai Lama had made a number of visits to the country, meeting then president {w|Nelson Mandela} in 1996 and visiting again in 1999 and 2004.== Sources == 
[[Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs dies aged 56]]The co-founder and former chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Steve Jobs has died yesterday at the age of 56, according to the company website.On August 24, Jobs resigned from his post as CEO. He has been fighting pancreatic cancer since 2004.Jobs, born in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, has built the most valuable technology company in the world, with a market value of $348.8 billion. He started Apple in 1976, and in 1984 the first {w|Macintosh} personal computer was released to the public. One year later he was fired from the company and he founded {w|NeXT}. In 1986 he bought {w|Pixar} which was acquired by {w|The Walt Disney Company} in 2005. In 1996, following Apple Computer's purchase of NeXT, Jobs returned to Apple and soon after reassumed the role of CEO. In 1998 Apple introduced the {w|iMac} personal computer, in 2001 the {w|iPod} music player and the following year the {w|Mac OS X} operating system was released. 2007 was the year of the {w|iPhone} smartphone, then the {w|iPad} tablet computer in 2010.A statement on Apple's website, the homepage of which currently displays a black and white photograph and the text "Steve Jobs 1955-2011", states: ¡°Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.¡±United States President {w|Barack Obama} said "Steve was among the greatest of American innovators ¡ª brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it".Former Microsoft CEO {w|Bill Gates} responded to Jobs' death with a statement on his blog: "The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. ... I will miss Steve immensely." The current Microsoft CEO {w|Steve Ballmer} also expressed condolences for Jobs and described him as "one of the founders of our industry and a true visionary".== Sources == 
[[Apple executive Steve Jobs dies at age 56]]Another successful attack on free speech and open discussion by the the ban it and censor it brigade. If articles had been written condemning white people ,white speech and the the wearing of white fashions nothing would be said. Let anyone criticise the indigenous or quasi-indigenous element of society and it's off to court for a ruling that it's upsetting or demeaning and must not be allowed. Who are these so easily offended people and what do they imagine their actions will achieve? On my part it's contempt,disregard and and an absolute determination to tell it how it is as often as possible. If the indigenous community don't like criticism or feel so perfect as to be above reproach they can say so like anyone else, not run off to the courts. Remember it's the taxpayer who funds these jaunts into judicial ego stroking, from funds dispensed by guilt ridden government consumed by an angst that few ordinary working people feel or care about but who see their tax dollars squandered on these stunts. Enough, lets put an end to political correctness, to censorship and to infringements on freedom of speech.
[[Liraglutide shows promise for diabetes treatment]]Liraglutide is showing promise for treating type I and type II diabetes. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 of rDNA origin. It binds to the same receptors to which  glucagon normally binds. Glucagon normally causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream. GLP-1 blocks the receptors and keeps the liver from releasing too much glucose into the bloodstream, reducing excess blood sugar levels and the need for insulin.Interestingly, Liraglutide is based on a compound found in the Gila Monster's saliva. In that respect it is similar to other drugs such as chlorotoxin from a desert scorpion and ACE inhibitors.It can be used in combination with oral drugs like metformin or sulfonylurea and also insulin. It is taken as a single dose daily via an injection pen. Other treatments such as Byetta need to be injected multiple times per day. It does not cause weight gain and my even cause weight loss. There is even some possibility of using Liraglutide for weight loss in non-diabetics.It is administrated by injection only. Some patients may be concerned about self-injection. There is also a possible increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer or thyroid cancer.As with any prescription treatment, doctors and patients must weigh the pros and cons for for each case.== Sources == 
[[Italian Wikipedia disables their site in response to new Bill]]Italian Wikipedia has disabled their site from users as a response to Italian Prime Minister {W|Silvio Berlusconi}'s recent law that is designed to restrict the use of information obtained through wire taps. The Italian government introduced the DDL Intercettazioni Bill to prevent newspapers and internet sites publishing information obtained through wire tapping devices. The introduction of these laws came shortly after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi¡¯s conversations with a prostitute were published. It was paragraph 29 however, requiring removal of content detrimental to a person¡¯s image within 48 hours, without appeal, which has caused Italian Wikipedia to shut down the use of its site. The writer would also be forced to pay a fine of up to 12 000 pounds. In protest and fear that the site would be unable to respond to the severity of the new restrictions, Italian Wikipedia warned its users that the site was in danger of being deleted permanently.  The site feautured on it's homepage: "Unfortunately, the very pillars on which Wikipedia has been built, neutrality, freedom, and verifiability of its contents ¨C are likely to be heavily compromised by the law proposal known as ¡®Wiretapping Act."The law allows any person who is offended by any online publication to invoke the law, without requiring verification by an impartial judge that the material is actually offensive. The online encyclopaedia's protest has caused outcry amongst Italian people who use the site regularly. Journalists have protested in Rome, with some taping their mouths as an objection to the limits the laws place on free speech.  The Italian government have modified the bill in response to the public reaction. The laws now only affect the large news websites. The Italian Wikipedia site is now no longer in danger of removal. However, as daily Italian newspaper {w|Il Tempo} states, there is still nothing to protect "voices with authority" - such as those who write for larger news organisations and publish online. The recent modification "is a victory for Wikipedia, but remains a serious blow against press freedom in Italy," said founder of English Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales.Head of the Italian parliamentary justice commission, Ms Bongiorno originally took responsibility for abdicating the draft Bill. She now states that the proposals have become a law for the Prime Minister¡¯s benefits, ¡°with no bearing on the problems of ordinary people.¡± Italian President, Silvio Berlusconi has affirmed that the laws were introduced for the privacy of all and not for his own political gain. == Sources ==

[[Nigeria NAFDAC Director General launches their anti-counterfeiting technologies that is based on SMS amid many controversies]]'''On Thursday, 29th September 2011, the Director General of the Nigerian  National Agency for Food, Drugs Administration and Control announced the launching of their Mobile Authentication Service. This is meant to authenticate drugs and controlled food. See for details of the launch and comments please see: http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/news/21658-%E2%80%98our-battle-against-fake-drugs%E2%80%99.html However, the MAS launching was news but, the fact''' is that there are loads of controversies and complains about the project. The issues bother on the company that was used in delivering the project which left much doubts about the NAFDAC DG¡¯s transparency and in the project administration. Preliminary investigations revealed the following: Although the project has been launched, there are serious concerns of complicity, compromise and lack of professionalism in the delivery of the project; it does not however appear that the Presidency is aware of this. The above is buttressed by the following:Observers are still studying the matter to understand what is really responsible for this leadership failure: if it is purely a factor of ignorance, or overzealousness in his ¡°attempt to record some kind of achievements¡± as a match for the lofty standards set by his predecessor¡¯s, or if it is to do with any personal interest. The fact that there are also unanswered questions of management irresponsibility, lack of prudency and respect for institutional contractual obligations by Dr. Paul Orhii in his administration of the Project. Dr. Paul Orhii, against the rules, all know standards and professional ethics officially awarded multiple contracts on the same project to different organizations; he also encouraged each party to invest their resource while asking them to move from one phase of the project to then next but he finally refused honoring his contractual obligations; neither did he provide the parties with official termination of the contract nor any explanations explanation for his strange actions. People have questioned the rationale behind this act given his backgrounds in Law: could it be that he is just careless or, intoxicated by the power that his position is accorded with or, is he deliberately taking undue advantage of the weakness of the law in his host environment. All these are subjects of research by keen followers of events and developments in African leaders with focus on Nigeria.Observers¡¯ concerns are based on the fact that this act has raised litigations against NAFDAC which will usually end up in the organization paying out huge sum of money in legal fees and penalties for breach of contracts by the time the cases are disposed of. Unfortunately, in many scenarios, such cases are usually not finished during the tenor of the officer in question and the defaulting officers are often not brought back to account for their leadership failure.The question is can we really estimate how much this kind of leadership systems contributes to the nation's underdevelopment as currently witnessed in many quarters?== Sources ==

[[Cameroon 2011 presidential election]]Today the 2011 Cameroonian presidential election is being held. Paul Biya, the incumbent, is one of 23 candidates and is expected to win. Indeed, many people are not voting for this reason. "Why bother voting, we know who is going to win." "Go out in the street, talk to ten people, ten out of ten will say Biya will win." There are two reasons given by Cameroonians for this. One is corruption, "whoever I vote for, they take that vote and give it to Biya" is the attitude of some I've talked to. The other reason is that there is only a single round of voting, and whoever gets the plurality wins. With 23 candidates, Biya could win even if he only gets 30% of the vote, if no other candidate gets more.Cameroon is a mineral rich country. Biya has been the president since 1982, and has won each  election since multi-party elections were first held in 1992. == Sources ==

[[Indian singer Jagjit Singh dies]]Take a closer look at the edit history, and you'll find my edits didn't add up all that much.  I separate edits like that deliberately, so I and others can reconstruct just what I did.Publication must be by an independent reviewer; if a reviewer gets too involved with an article during review, the reviewer must disqualify xyrself from publishing.  So I keep a close eye on the nature and quantity of edits I made to an article during review.A class of college journalism students at the {w|University of Wollongong} are submitting articles to Wikinews this semester.  They're here to learn; and demonstrating improvements is, when possible, preferable to simply telling them "that's not good enough".  Their professor, so I understand, looks at whether they continue to improve.  When called for, I'll try to take things as close to the edge of independent review as I feel I can.  If what's needed is more than I can do within independent review, of course, I have to send it back for more work.Breaking down my edits makes it easier to judge how much I change, and also allows the author to understand better what I changed and why.
[[Habert¨¹rk media sparks outrage over woman¡¯s murder photo in Turkey]]A photo of a naked and bloodstained murdered woman was shown on the front page of Turkey's Habert¨¹rk Daily print edition last Friday, causing a social and media uproar. The article was titled "The last point of violence against women", and whilst there are daily reports of abuse and ¡®honour-killings¡¯, Habert¨¹rk has been the first to show a photo so graphic and uncensored. The photograph clearly shows the woman's identity and the kitchen knife used to kill her that was still planted in her back. Habert¨¹rk has been highly criticized by social media users, readers, celebrities, woman organizations, professional press organisations and even its own staff members, with some claiming violation of journalism ethics rules. Habert¨¹rk¡¯s own staff columnist Balcicek Ilter said, "the photo of the violated woman on my newspaper's front page is violence itself." Habert¨¹rk reported her husband, 45, murdered the woman, 38, in {W|Manisa}. A mother of two children, they separated after he was abusive towards her, the paper said. At a time where campaigns are targeting the issue of violence against Turkish women, Habert¨¹rk's editor-in-chief, Fatih Altayl?, believes this photo counters reduced sensitivity to violence amongst the public. "I would have used that image even if it was my own mother," he said. Habert¨¹rk firmly believes they made the correct choice in publishing the photograph even when asked by woman's advocacy groups to apologise. "We demand the resignation of the writer of this news and the person who approved it. We call for journalism in print and on TV that stands for the right perspective," said Canan G¨¹ll¨¹ from the Turkish Federation of Women Associations.The Press Council convened Sunday to find a solution to this matter and its Secretary General, Dr. Hasan Sinar states that Habert¨¹rk has "ignored the Press Council and the Professional Press Principles" since mid 2009. While this article has caught a lot of negative attention, there are supporters of Habert¨¹rk's choice in using the photo. Serpil Sancar, head of Ankara University¡¯s Women¡¯s Issues Center agrees stating, "This photograph illustrates the violence women have to face. I don't think showing the truth is bad. Seeing blood sets the conscience in motion."Since talking with Brussels over European Union membership in 2005, Turkey pledged to strengthen human rights and the protection of women. Earlier this year {W|Human Rights Watch} reported "Turkey¡¯s flawed family violence protection system leaves women and girls across the country unprotected against domestic abuse." The rate of female murders has increased 1,400% since 2004. The {W|Council of Europe}'s commissioner for human rights, Thomas Hammarberg, is scheduled to be in Turkey currently. A report by Hammarberg earlier this year noted improvements in press freedom, but nonetheless claimed "There is a need for immediate measures to defend these rights [freedom of expression and the media] and support an environment of tolerance to accommodate opposing views."== Sources == 
[[Australian Coal Association releases final warning of carbon tax impacts]]The Australian Coal Association has yesterday released the results of detailed modeling of the impact that a carbon tax could potentially have on the industry, as a final warning to the Federal Parliament ahead of Wednesday¡¯s Lower House vote on the Clean Energy Future Legislation.The study, undertaken independently by ACIL Tasman suggests that over 10 years the carbon tax will put at risk over 21,000 jobs within the coal industry, and could force the premature closure of 17% of black coal mines operating in Australia. The results indicate that over this 10-year period, revenue will be 19% lower and employment 27% lower than without the proposed carbon pricing scheme.The Australian Government¡¯s Clean Energy Future website states that as the carbon tax only targets the top 500 polluters in the nation, the majority of coal mines will only have small liabilities under a carbon price as they do not release significant amounts of greenhouse gasses. The government has allocated $1.3 billion to a Coal Jobs Sector Package, to secure jobs and cover costs of carbon abatement technologies for the mines that produce the most carbon pollution. A further $70 million has been allocated for a Coal Mining Abatement Technology Support Package, which will provide grants for research and demonstration of new technologies that will cut carbon pollution in the industry. The ACIL Tasman study notes that it has taken the proposed $1.3 billion Coal Jobs Sector Package into consideration when determining the possible impact of the carbon tax. The report suggests that in the best case scenario, the package will not prevent any premature closures, but will delay 4 out of the 21 projected closures by one year. The report asserts that the $1.3 billion package is inadequate to fully safeguard the industry. Prime Minister Julia Gillard conceded earlier this year that some gaseous mines would be threatened under the new carbon tax, but noted that there would still be expansion in the industry that would create new jobs. A Climate Institute analysis conducted earlier in the year predicted that up to 3575 new jobs would still be created within the coal industry by 2020. ACA Chairman John Pegler stated that the Australian government had underestimated the potential impact of the carbon tax, and in a statement released in conjunction with the report said ¡°This impact is in the face of a clear understanding that the loss of these jobs will not result in a reduction in global greenhouse gases from coal mining because production from these mine closures will shift offshore to Australia¡¯s competitors.¡°Australia is surrendering our competitive advantage to emerging coal exporters such as Mozambique, Mongolia and established competitors such as Indonesia, South Africa, Colombia and Canada.¡±Coal is Australia¡¯s second largest export earner, and according to the study could be facing costs of $18 billion in the first ten years of the carbon tax.The Business Council of Australia has also appealed to the Federal Government to introduce safeguards into the carbon tax legislation to ensure that Australian industries remain competitive in international markets. The council¡¯s CEO, Jennifer Westacott warned that the proposed $23 per tonne carbon price was too high for Australia to maintain its competitiveness, and put the economy at serious risk. Previous treasury modelling has indicated that the Australian economy will continue to grow under a carbon tax, with an estimated 16% increase in average incomes from today¡¯s levels by 2020. The modelling has also predicted an national employment increase of 1.6 million jobs by 2020.  The final vote in the House of Representatives is set down for 9:00am October 12 AEDT. == Sources == 
[[Eyewitnesses challenge Egyptian state media impartiality in fatal protests]]With at least 24 dead, eye-witnesses to Sunday night's protests in Egypt assert state-run media broadcast unreliable information, and incorrectly claimed {w|Coptic} protesters provoked military action.Challenging the official narrative provided by Egyptian state media channels, including Channel One and {W|Nile TV|Nile News}, blog reports and other social media coverage dispute early reports on Channel One that those protesting threw stones, and fired live ammunition, at military personnel. Further allegations assert coverage was selective, with footage of military vehicles pursuing and running over protesters not aired.Nile News conducted interviews with injured on each side of the clash. Military and security barred protestors from reaching their building. Nile News anchor Hesham Assy said: " We did the best we could, given the circumstances, as it was very difficult to leave the building last night." Despite this, journalist Mai Elwakil writing for {W|Almasry Alyoum} claims "the coverage [overall] seems to have led viewers to believe that Coptic protesters caused the violence."Challenging the stance of state media, it is claimed the military fired upon protesters, and deliberately attacked them using excessive force. Members of the state media also question the coverage; state TV worker Taghreed al-Dossouky announced via her Twitter account, "I reject the Egyptian state media's coverage because it incites sectarianism, and I condemn all those who partake in it."At least 24 people were killed and over 200 wounded as the demonstration turned violent.== Sources == 
[[Carbon tax debate rages in Australia ahead of lower house vote]]The lower house debate on the Australian carbon tax has been extended past its scheduled 5 pm finish time, with the House of Representatives now considering amendments to the carbon pricing package until 11 pm this evening, ahead of tomorrow¡¯s 9 am vote. Opposition¡¯s climate change spokesman Greg Hunt has indicated that he will seek to amend the legislation¡¯s proposed July 2012 implementation to a starting date contingent on the result of the next federal election, due in 2013. This follows criticism that Prime Minister Julia Gillard has broken her 2010 election promise that there would be no carbon tax under her leadership to introduce the Clean Energy Future legislation, and in doing so has not given Australians a fair opportunity to vote on the issue of a carbon tax.Climate Change Minister, Greg Combet, yesterday announced amendments to the carbon tax, which would enable big fuel users to opt in to the carbon pricing scheme and take advantage of carbon offsets. Mr Hunt has stated that these changes will still mean costs to Australian travellers, and has criticized the government for ¡°hiding the real costs from the Australian people only days before the Parliament is supposed to vote on this legislation.¡±The voting week opened amidst controversy that the Joint Select Committee on Australia¡¯s Clean Energy Future legislation declined to publish all but 267 of the 4,500 submissions received from the general public on the legislation on the basis that the remainder were ¡®correspondence¡¯. Many Australians expressed outrage over a two sentence email supporting the carbon tax being published as a submission, while detailed submissions opposing the legislation were deemed correspondence and not published. A dissenting report published by the Coalition last week outlines the concerns expressed in the unpublished submissions and recommends that the legislation not be passed.== Sources ==

[[New antitrust law introduced to Ecuador]]Ecuador's president Rafael Correa established a new antitrust law yesterday which specifies that news media owners and bankers cannot hold significant financial stakes in other industries.  The law will essentially prevent any company gaining a monopoly in another industry.It is a move which Correa says will bring "a change in the country's power and property structure."The law has been heavily criticised by Ecuador's business community who say the law only gives Correa more power by making his government the referee of monopolistic behaviour.Pablo Davila, president of the Ecuadorian Business Committee says the law gives the executive branch "excessive power to control and sanction" private enterprises.He was particularly scathing of the fact that the law demands media owners and bankers to divest holdings in other industries saying "from our point of view, doesn't benefit competition but rather hurts competition."The two sectors have until July 2012 to divest and are able to have only six percent of their assets in other industries or face fines of up to twelve percent of their investment.== Sources == 
[[Iran continues to lash out at film industry]]An {w|Iran|Iranian} court in {w|Tehran} yesterday confirmed film director {w|Jafar Panahi}'s sentence to six years in jail, and a twenty-year ban on filmmaking. Charges against the award-winning director were summarised by state media as, "[...] acting against national security and propaganda against the regime".In September, before the original sentence was handed down, Panahi lamented, "[w]hen a film-maker does not make films it is as if he is jailed. Even when he is freed from the small jail, he finds himself wandering in a larger jail". With the ban now in-place, the filmmaker's This is not a Film, which premi¨¨red at {w|Canne Film festival}, may be his last work for two decades. The handheld-shot documentary covers Panahi' struggle with censorship whilst being prosecuted.Panahi's is the second high-profile case this week; actress {w|Marzieh Vafamehr} was sentenced to 90 lashes and one year in jail for starring in the controversial {w|Australia|Australian}-produced film My Tehran For Sale, directed by Iranian-Australian {w|Granaz Moussavi}. The film, produced by {w|Adelaide}-based Cyan Films, tells of a young Tehranhi actress whose theatre work is banned by the government. The film, being distributed illegally in Iran, was heavily criticised by Iran¡¯s conservative commentators, leading to Vafamehr's July arrest. In an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation¡¯s PM radio programme, producers Julie Ryan and Kate Croser state they had not set out to produce a political film. Stressing, "[w]e definitely didn't set out to make a film that criticised the government". The role played by Vafemehr shows her several times with a shaved head, or without a hijab.Australian foreign minister {w|Kevin Rudd}'s office issued a statement condemning the sentence, and urging the protection of all "Iranians and foreign citizens".== Sources == 
[[Israeli Solider Traded for 1,027 Prisoners]]After a three-hour discussion between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, a deal was announced Tuesday to trade Israeli Staff Sergeant, Gilad Schalit, for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners.  An Egyptian official said, "After 64 months of tough negotiations we were able to complete the deal. It was a very difficult task, which included thousands of hours of negotiations."Staff Sergeant Gilad Schalit, the Israeli solider, was captured during a border raid on June 25, 2006. After years of failed negotiations, Netanyahu said, "I believe we reached the best deal that we can reach at this time, a stormy time in the Middle East.¡±Since Schalit¡¯s capture, Hamas and Israel have been under conflict with series of suicide bombers, blockades, and invasions. But after the trade was announced, Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza¡¯s Hamas prime minister, was seen smiling and throwing candy to celebratory crowds. The ethics involved in trading are of concern as Netanyahu said, "There is built-in tension between the desire to return a kidnapped soldier ... and the need to preserve the security of the citizens of Israel.¡± He wants the best outcome for all involved. Among the prisoners includes 315 prisoners serving life sentences, suggesting their involvement in Israelis deaths. Almagor, a group representing victims of Palestinian attacks said this in criticism towards the trade, "In the end Netanyahu has surrendered to Hamas. The terrorists who are released are a danger to the citizens of Israel." == Sources == 
[[Jailed Swedish journalists to be tried as terrorists]]Two Swedish journalists are being tried for terrorism in Ethiopia on Tuesday, after entering from neighboring country Somalia without permission. The freelance journalists allegedly aided a terrorist group and were wounded in a gunfight, in which 15 rebels were killed. Ethiopian Prime Minister {W|Meles Zenawi} says the two imprisoned Swedish journalists "made their way into Ethiopia with a terrorist organization that had killed 70 people who worked for a mining company in an attack." He says "it would be a criminal relationship in any country"."They are, at the very least, messenger boys of a terrorist organization. They are not journalists," the prime minister said. "Why would a journalist be involved with a terrorist organization and enter a country with that terrorist organization, escorted by armed terrorists, and participate in a fighting in which this terrorist organization was involved? If that is journalism, I don't know what terrorism is," says Zenawi.The journalists were jailed after entering into Ethiopia's troubled {W|Ogaden} region to cover rebel activity in the area. Zenawi claims one of the journalists was arrested on a previous attempt to enter illegally. "The second time he was seized with a terrorist organization in combat."Journalist Anna Roxvall, who is acting as facilitator of the Swedish journalists says the claim that one of the journalists was arrested previously is wrong. "No, no, no. It is clean cut a lie", she says.Swedish media have been denied access to the country to attend the trial. Ola Larsmo, writer and chairman of the Swedish Pen says "if Swedish journalists are not allowed into the country, we will not know what is happening". Zenawi says "we do not need to Swedish journalists to prove that our courts operate in accordance with international standards."Sveriges Radio, Sveriges Television, TT and Dagens Nyheter journalists have all applied for visa for the 18 October trial. The two journalists face 18 years in Ethiopian prison.== Sources == 
[[Editor of Folha 8 jailed for one year after publishing military corruption allegations]]Angolan journalist, William Tonet, has been sentenced to one year in prison after being found guilty of publishing allegations of corruption by the military, in a case his lawyer claims is disproportionate. The Luanda court said Tonet had to either pay damages or face prison after he wrote a 2008 article in the Folha 8 newspaper, accusing three Angolan Armed Force generals of abuse of power and self-gain. The hearing, which concluded on Monday, was criticised by the offender¡¯s lawyer, David Mendes. Mendes said the sentence against Tonet was disproportiante and incomprehensible. ¡°The findings of the court do not correspond to the basic norms of the law and the fine is exorbitant¡±.At the end of the hearing, the court dismissed the payment of 10 million kwanzas in damages to the victims, as Tonet chose to spend a year in jail. ¡°Where am I going to find the money to pay the claimants? I prefer to go to prison¡±, he said.Tonet has accused the ruling party MPLA of targeting him. The editor addressed reporters after the trial to accuse the regime of regarding him as a ¡°man to beat down¡±. Mendes agreed with Tonet, saying the Angolan President¡¯s regime, that has been in power since 1975, wants to imprison Tonet ¡°at all costs¡±.Protests over the Angolan government started in March this year, and have been oppressed by police. President Jose dos Santos has also cracked down on opposition of his regime. Another protest will take place on Saturday to call for the government to free activists who have been detained after earlier demonstrations. == Sources == 
[[Review of Freedom of Information fees]]The fees for Freedom of Information requests are to be reviewed following a survey that ranked Australia¡¯s laws 39th out of 89 countries.In 2009 Kevin Rudd made significant changes to the legislation, abolishing application fees and simplifying the public interest test. Even after these changes, the minister for privacy and freedom of information has estimated the cost of FOI requests at $27 million between 2009 and 2010.A senior journalism lecturer, who worked on the study, Johan Lidberg, said that application and processing fees could be avoided.¡°To have a simple request process, including verbal requests and have a simple appeal system to an information commissioner or ombudsman that¡¯s not costly,¡± Lidberg said. The Australian Information Commissioner reviewing the laws, John McMillan, will consider a variation of charges that depend on the characteristics of the request.McMillan¡¯s report will be appraised by several Freedom of Information stakeholders and is due for completion in January 2012.== Sources == 
[[Communication Commission of Kenya plans new broadcasting regulations]]The Communication Commission of Kenya has announced that it is in the process of introducing new regulations for the broadcast media, meaning radio and television broadcasters will need to reschedule some programming.The new regulations will be put in place in an attempt to prevent the airing of material deemed as unsuitable for children and minors during periods when it is likely this demographic will be present in the audience. Francis Wangusi, the CCK acting director general, of the broadcast content advisory council has already finalised the new law that will affect broadcasting corporations. However, the regulations are still under consultation before being formally ratified and put in place.The law has been designed to regulate FM radio stations that broadcast programmes containing adult content in the morning. It will also introduce a family broadcasting time between 5:00am and 10:00pm to television broadcasters showing inappropriate material when children are likely to be watching. ¡°These are programmes or movies classified/rated as General Exhibition or rated 10 by Kenya Film Censorship Board. The transition from family-oriented to a more adult programming after the watershed time of 10.00 PM shall be gradually executed," reads one section of the code. Programmes considered to be of interest to young viewers but require adult supervision should now be aired after 10:00pm. All programs will also need to be preceeded by an advisory notice of at least 5 seconds that announce the rating and content of the upcoming show. "Broadcasters are encouraged to include in all parental guided programmes warnings in other publicity materials like the TV page in newspapers and TV guides," adds the code. However, any registered broadcasting station will be able to prescribe its own code subject to the CCK for approval. The new code will also concern handling and resolving broadcast related complaints.The new regulations come as a response to the finding that content is becoming a key factor in attracting audiences to any broadcasting platform. They are also in response to the recent observation by the Government that there has been increased use of vulgar language by journalists. The CCK code states that it recognises that, ¡°Broadcasting by its nature exerts a strong influence on a community. Both radio and television combined are accessible to nearly all the people of Kenya, including the young.¡± The CCK has also assured audiences that it recognises the need for freedom of speech and right to opinion, and that radio and television stations have the freedom to produce such programmes. However, they must make sure that each programme adheres to both professional and generally accepted values, ethical and moral standards.== Sources == 
[[Lower house passes Australia's carbon tax legislation]]The Australian carbon tax legislation has been passed in the lower house of Parliament this morning in a narrow majority of 74 to 72 votes.The carbon tax package contains 18 pieces of legislation and places a $23 per tonne price on carbon emissions from its implementation in July 2012. This will rise at a fixed rate of 2.5% per annum before transitioning into a flexible price estimated at $A29 per tonne. The scheme works towards a target of 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050.The tax is aimed at big businesses, with the top 500 polluters in the nation liable for their emissions. The government has conceded that many businesses will pass the costs on to consumers, and have estimated an initial $635 per year cost-of-living increase for the average family. More than half of the revenue raised from the carbon tax has been allocated to providing household assistance to help cover these costs. Income taxes will also be cut in order to alleviate the increased costs.The lower house also passed the Labor government¡¯s $300 million Steel Transformation Plan, which offers assistance to steel makers as they are considered vulnerable to international trade. This bill is now set to become law alongside the Clean Energy Future legislation. The victory was much needed for Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who has seen a steady decline in popularity over the past year. The Prime Minister, whose legislation won support of crossbench MPs Rob Oakeshott, Tony Windsor, and Andrew Wilkie, declared that today was ¡°a significant day for all Australians and future Australians who want to see a better environment¡±. Opposition leader Tony Abbott has reinforced his campaign promise that if elected he will repeal the tax. Mr Abbott today declared ¡°I am giving you the most definite commitment any politician can give that this tax will go. This is a pledge in blood- this tax will go¡±. Finance Minister Penny Wong dismissed the opposition leader¡¯s claims as ¡°a bit dramatic¡±, and stating that Mr Abbott would have a great deal of trouble in repealing the new laws.  Controversy arose mid-last month when the legislation was introduced into Parliament and it was revealed that unlike most international carbon pricing schemes, the Australian legislation granted property rights on carbon units. Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change Mark Dreyfus noted that once in place, repeal of the carbon tax would amount to acquisition of property by the Commonwealth and would therefore make the government liable to pay compensation potentially in the billions of dollars. Greens deputy leader Christine Milne has also noted that businesses would reject Mr Abbott¡¯s pledge to repeal the carbon tax, as their primary concern would be certainty when investing in carbon credits. The Labor government has vowed to defend the carbon tax if it loses government to Tony Abbott. The legislation will now be passed to the senate for a November 21st vote. == Sources == 
[[Former Ukrainian PM Tymoshenko jailed over Russian gas deal]]In his judgement, judge Rodion Kireyev said "Tymoshenko intentionally used her powers to criminal ends and, acting deliberately, carried out actions ... which led to heavy consequences." The judge ruled that Tymoshenko abused her powers in 2009 by ordering the state energy firm Naftogaz to sign a $189 million gas deal with Russia.The court heard that due to this deal Ukraine lost an overwhelming amount of money . Judge Kireyev said Tymoshenko lost the gas firm Naftogaz 1.5 billion hryvna in the 10-year gas agreement. The court has ordered Tymoshenko to pay $189.5 million in compensation to Naftogaz, to purchase Russian gas. Ukraine¡¯s energy minister Yury Boyko told reporters that "We will fulfill the court decision and if the money is transferred to Naftogaz, it will be used to pay for gas supplies."This judgment has been the result of a three-month trial and Tymoshenko has been in custody since early August where she was arrested for contempt of court and violating court proceedings. Throughout the trail and again during her sentencing, Tymoshenko¡¯s supporters have been continually showing their support. In the surrounding streets of the court her supporters were met with riot police to keep them in line. Many shouted "freedom for Yulia!" and "down with the bandits!" during the trail. European Union officials have concerns that Tymoshenko¡¯s sentence will promote strains between Ukraine and the West and it will jeopardize Ukraine¡¯s hope to sign an association and join the EU. Before the verdict, the EU said Ukraine must "ensure a fair, transparent and impartial process in any appeal in the case of Ms Tymoshenko and in the other trials related to members of the former government." Their response to the verdict, however, was of extreme disappointment and in a statement from the EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said, "The EU will reflect on its policies towards Ukraine."

[[Clashes Between Syrian Troops, Defectors Kill 20]]Syrian rights activists say clashes between government security forces and armed men believed to be army defectors have killed at least 19 people as the European Union imposed sanctions on the country's biggest state bank, The Commercial Bank of Syria. The United States had already imposed sanctions on the bank in August.Syria has used military force to crush months of opposition protests calling for the ouster of the current president, Bashar al-Assad. The U.N. human-rights office say more than 2,900 people have been killed during the government's crackdown.  Syria has blamed much of the violence on "armed gangs" and "terrorists" although their claims are yet to be verified. In London, Britain summoned Syria's ambassador to discuss allegations of Syrian intimidation of protesters in Britain who are demonstrating against President Assad.  British Foreign Secretary William Hague told Parliament Thursday that harassment of demonstrators in Britain is unacceptable. The summons comes a day after the United States announced it has charged a Syrian-born U.S. citizen with spying on anti-Assad protesters in the United States.

[[Boston Globe criticised for outing FBI informant]]Federal Bureau of Investigation}The Boston Globe has copped criticism for jeopardising the safety of a confidential FBI informant last week. The story written by Shelley Murphy and Maria Cramer appeared on the front page of The Boston Globe and has quickly stirred up a storm of criticism.The informant led the FBI to James 'Whitey' Bulger, a former mob boss in the Boston area, who is accused of committing 19 murders in South Boston. The informant was rewarded US$2 million dollars for their efforts in reporting the whereabouts of Bulger and was also promised complete anonymity.It is legal for The Boston Globe to release the informant's details under the US Constitution, but it does raise ethical issues for the journalists involved. What they write could potentially put the informant in harm's way and also tarnish the FBI's reputation.Former federal prosecutor Michael Kendall told Joe Dwinell of the Boston Herald that it might be the publication's ¡°constitutional right ¡ª but it doesn¡¯t mean you should.¡±It is feared that this case will scare people off from assisting law enforcement with confidential tips on the whereabouts of criminals. This could have major ramifications for the FBI's work on terrorism and organised crime cases.In The Huffington Post, Rebecca Shapiro outlined how dangerous it is to release the details of a confidential informant."Releasing her identity could not only put the tipster in danger, but could also dissuade future people from providing information to the FBI for other cases", she said.The Boston Globe has released a statement clarifying that they felt it was necessary to publish the full details of the story and that doing so would not put the informant in any danger.Peter Schworm wrote in The Boston Globe, "Editors who oversaw the Globe story said they deliberated at length over whether to print her name, but were ultimately convinced that doing so posed no danger."The Boston Globe is standing staunchly behind the two journalists who wrote the story, Murphy and Cramer, with a number of defenses. The most prominent of which was that identifying the informant "served a vital public interest".== Sources ==

[[BBC reporter convicted over links to radical Islamic group]]A {w|Tajikistan} court sentenced a {w|BBC} reporter to three years jail on Friday, guilty of complicity in banned Islamic group {w|Hizb ut-Tahrir}, but he was immediately granted amnesty and released.Urunboy Usmonov, 60, was accused of spreading Islamic propaganda through his reporting and failing to inform authorities about alleged criminal activities planned by the radical group. The amnesty legislation, that allowed Usmovov to walk free, was only written into Tajik law in September.Usmonov, who has been reporting with the BBC for 10 years, sparked international condemnation when he was arrested in June for allegedly belonging to the Hizb ut-Tahrir. The BBC World Service maintains Usomonov's innocence, saying that his meetings with the group were purely related to his journalist activities."Whatever I have done has been in accordance with journalistic guidelines," Urunboy Usmonov said."Journalists should be free to go about their work throughout the world without fear of imprisonment or reprisals."Usmonov claimed during his trial that he was beaten by guards and had cigarettes burnt into his arms, as well as being forced to sign a confession."We also intend to press for answers over the torture and mistreatment Urunboy suffered while in custody, and to raise real concerns about shortcomings in the legal process," said Peter Horrocks, BBC's Director of Global News.Hizb ut-Tahrir attracts thousands of young recruits and is openly critical of the Tajik regime, wanting to overthrow its leadership to have an Islamic state across the Middle East and Central Asia.Takjikistan authorities are taking strict action to eradicate radical Islamists that are increasing in popularity, imprisoning 158 people in the last year on charges of extremism. Government critics warn that this crackdown is only driving these groups further underground.== Sources == 
[[Radiation hotspots detected by Japanese citizens' groups]]A Japanese citizens¡¯ group, working in tandem with a respected nuclear research centre, has in recent days located more than 20 radiation hotspots in and around the capital Tokyo, well outside the evacuated zone around Japan¡¯s damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Included in the results from testing undertaken this week is a reading showing elevated cesium levels in a patch of dirt just metres from where children play baseball. The findings, which continue a trend of raised levels of radiation being discovered in unexpected areas often well outside the government-mandated evacuation zone, suggest that contamination from the Fukushima plant may have spread to places to date not even contemplated by authorities.Another citizens¡¯ group has detected radiation levels reaching up to 5.82 microsieverts an hour in Funabashi, Chiba Prefecture, over 200 kilometres from Fukushima. In Yokohama, south of Tokyo, abnormally high concentrations of strontium-90 were found by local officials on the roof of an apartment building. Strontium-90, with a half-life of 29 years, can cause various forms of cancer due in cases of accumulated exposure, and is one of the radioactive elements released into the atmosphere by the explosions at Fukushima.The revelations have fueled concern about whether Japanese authorities adequately understand how fallout from a series of hydrogen explosions at the plant, triggered by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, is distributed across the country. Tokyo is located about 250 kilometres from the damaged reactors, well outside the mandatory 20-kilometre exclusion zone around the crippled plant.Hideo Yamakazi, an environmental analysis expert at Kinki University, says the likely impact of the finds on human health should be kept in perspective.¡°These results are highly localised, so there is no cause for panic,¡± he said. ¡°Still, there are steps the government could be taking, like decontaminating the highest spots.¡±"We've always known that there are 'hot spots' where contamination levels are higher than other areas, but these tiny spots are like 'micro hot spots'," said John Kuramochi, a Yokohama official in charge of monitoring contamination. It is believed that the accumulation of rainwater and sediments containing contaminated material is likely to explain the hot spots.The ongoing discovery of contaminated hotspots has led Japanese authorities to ramp up some monitoring and clean-up efforts, including conducting fly-over radiation readings from aeroplanes. However, critics of the government efforts call for a more comprehensive approach, claiming that fly-overs are unlikely to detect highly localised contamination.The citizens¡¯ group which made the latest Tokyo findings, called the Radiation Defence Project, encourages members to collect soil samples from near their homes. The samples are then submitted to the Yokohama-based Isotope Research Institute for testing.Takeo Hayashida, the Tokyo resident responsible for the latest find, measured levels of 138 000 becquerels per square metre of cesium-137, a radioactive element associated with increased risk of cancer. The levels are comparable to those recorded in parts of the mandatory exclusion zone, within 20 kilometres of the damaged plant. Mr Hayashida has now decided to relocate his family to the south of the country.The renewed concerns about hotspot contaminated came as it was revealed that bottles of radioactive radium were responsible for dangerous levels of radiation in Tokyo¡¯s Setagaya district. The elevated reading, widely reported in the international media, was therefore not linked to fallout from the Fukushima plant, as initially feared.== Sources ==
